Chapter 21

: An Old Friend In A Different World
In that instant, Klein even believed that he had transmigrated back.
However, the elegant gas lamp surrounded by brass grids and the silver-
inlaid tin, which Old Neil kept his handground coffee in, made him
recognize the reality he was in.
The transmigrator, Emperor Roselle, is really a fellow countryman of mine?
He was using Simplified Chinese—which doesn’t exist in this world—to
record secrets? With the indescribable feeling of identifying an old friend in
a different world, Klein quickly read through the three pages.
“18th November. Truly a fascinating matter. A blue-sky experimentation
and a chance mistake made me discover the pathetic fellow lost and trapped
in the deep darkness amid the storms. He can only approach the reality of
this world on the day of the full moon every month; yet, he is unable to
transmit his cries. He is lucky to have met me, the protagonist of this era.”
“After reading the paragraph I wrote above, I suddenly felt a little down.
Even my Chinese is written like a translation. Four decades have passed in
a finger snap. My past memories feel more like a dream.”
“1184, 1st January. At the grand New Year Gala, Lady Florena was truly
splendid.”
“2nd January. My diplomats are all idiots!”
“3rd January. I made a hasty choice back then. In hindsight, I should have
chosen the Apprentice, the Seer, or the Bandit. Unfortunately, there is no
way of redoing it.”
“4th January. Why are my children so stupid? I’ve repeated myself so many
times. Do not be fooled by those charlatans! The key thing about potions is
not about grasping them, but digesting them! It’s nothing about tapping
powers, but acting! And the name of a potion is not solely symbolic at its
core, but a concrete imagery, and the ‘key’ to digestion!”
“9th September. An alliance opposing me has been established. Feysac from
the north, Loen from the east, Feynapotter from the south. My enemies have
finally joined forces, but I have no fear. I will use facts to teach them that
the generations of weapons and knowledge cannot be compensated by mere
numbers and low-grade Sequencers. Besides, it’s not as though I do not
have subordinates. As for the higher-grades, heh heh. Have they forgotten
who I am?”
“23rd September. I have lost communications with the ship seeking the
Forsaken Land of the Gods. I should consider inventing wireless telegraphs.
I hope it would not be affected by the storm.”
“24th September. Miss Ithaca is more mesmerizing than Lady Florena.
Perhaps, I’m just being nostalgic about my youth.”
Due to the complexity of characters in Simplified Chinese, the font was
slightly larger than normal, leading to less content on each page.
Furthermore, for preservational and research purposes, the back of each
page was left empty. But even so, Klein still felt an upheaval of emotions
when he read the diary. In particular, Emperor Roselle’s description of the
crux of potions made him feel like he found the path to the solution. He was
thrilled at having learned a priceless secret.
Perhaps, this will be a beacon for my future path as a Beyonder! Well, the
three pages belong to entries at different times. It seems Emperor Roselle
only writes the year on the first entry of each year. It cannot be determined
which year the two pages with September and November belong to… Who
is the pathetic fellow he discovered?
What do “digesting” and “acting” actually mean?
Where is the Forsaken Land of the Gods? …
These questions bubbled in Klein’s head. It made him eager to immediately
gather all of Emperor Roselle’s diary and read it from cover to cover!
“Klein?” At that moment, Old Neil asked puzzledly across him.
Klein jolted awake as he hurriedly covered it up with a laugh. “I thought I
would be the most special one. I was trying to decipher and interpret it.”
“You are young indeed.” Old Neil nodded, laughing. “I once believed that I
was the most special one as well.”
Klein flipped through the three pages in his hand and after confirming that
he had not missed anything, he handed it over to Old Neil and thoughtlessly
asked, “Do we only have these few pages?”
I want to see more of Emperor Roselle’s diary! “Did you think there would
be many?” Old Neil caressed the scripts as his wrinkles deepened from his
scoff. “There are not many incidents a year that involve Beyonders and
mystery to begin with. Sigh, the major reason is the gradual extinction of
extraordinary species in our Northern Continent. Without them, there won’t
be a lot of potions, causing the number of Beyonders to reduce with time.
Sigh, over the past few centuries, dragons, giants, and elves have become
simply records in books. Even the seafolks are no longer seen near the
coastal waters.”
Upon hearing this, Klein suddenly thought of a meme. He immediately said
with a smile, “I think it’s time to establish a Dragons and Giants Protection
Association.”
Old Neil looked confused when he heard that. It took him quite some time
to figure out what it meant. After figuring out its meaning, he rapped the
table and laughed quite heartily in a not-so-gentlemanly manner.
“Haha, Klein, you really are humorous. This is a tradition of our Loen
Kingdom. It’s good that young people have a sense of humor. I believe we
shouldn’t be overly narrow in scope. Why are we only protecting dragons
and giants? It should be called Fantastic Beasts Protection Association.”
“No, no, no. How can we forget those poor plants?” Klein shook his head.
They exchanged looks and proclaimed in unison: “Fantastic Organisms
Protection Association!”
Both of them laughed tacitly. The awkwardness and unfamiliarity of the
atmosphere between them dissipated considerably.
“There are fewer interesting young people like you these days… Where was
I?” Old Neil’s wrinkles suffused a smile as he said, “I remember. There are
not many incidents a year that involve Beyonders and mystery to begin
with. The retards who revere Emperor Roselle are the minority of the
minority. It’s already pretty good that we can obtain three scripts… Well,
the other larger cathedrals or dioceses might have some…”
After muttering a few words, he took the approval note which Klein had
placed on the table earlier and took a look.
“Are they pistol bullets, rifle bullets, or steam-pressured bullets?”
“It’s a revolver,” answered Klein honestly.
“Alright. I’ll go get them. Ahem, do you have an armpit holster? As a
gentleman, we can’t let you have something bulging below your waist in
public.” Old Neil made a joke that all men understood.
“Heh, no. Do I need to get Captain to include it?” Klein smiled
cooperatively.
Old Neil stood up and said, “There’s no need. I just need to make a record.
It’s an accessory item. Repeat after me: accessory item.”
“Were you a teacher in the past?” joked Klein.
“I spent some time at the Church’s Sunday school and free schools.” Old
Neil waved the note and took out a key from the drawer. He then opened
the iron door that led into an inner chamber.
Beyonders do not seem much different from commoners… Klein murmured
silently before casting his gaze on the table where the three pages of the
diary were.
Emperor Roselle is indeed involved in the realm of mystery…
His diary is invaluable… To others, they are just pieces of scrap paper. It is
unknown when they will be deciphered, but they are a valuable treasure to
me! I wonder where the remaining parts of the diary are…
I have to think of ways to get more… Klein’s mind went through upheavals
as he could hardly calm down. This continued until Old Neil came out and
closed the iron door.
“Ten demon hunting bullets, thirty revolver bullets. An ox-hide armpit
holster, and a Seventh Unit, Special Operations Department badge. Please
count them and give them a try. Remember to sign the log book.” Old Neil
placed the items down on the table.
The revolver bullets were arranged neatly in a paper box which was divided
into three layers. The bullets shimmered with a yellow sheen just like the
bullets back home, but they appeared narrower.
As for the demon hunting bullets, they were kept in a small iron box. The
shape was identical to regular revolver bullets, but their surface was silver
in color. Upon a more careful examination, there were complicated and
dazzling patterns with tiny Sacred Emblems—a black background dotted
with stars and a half crimson moon—engraved at the bottom.
The ox-hide holster felt solid and it came with a belt and buckle. Beside it
was a badge half the size of a palm. It had a metallic background with
“Awwa County Police Department and Seventh Unit, Special Operations
Department” inscribed in silver text. They formed almost two sealed circles
and surrounded the “two crossed swords and a crown” police emblem.
“Unfortunately, it’s not a Nighthawks badge,” Klein said half wistfully and
half probingly.
Old Neil smiled and urged Klein to test the armpit holster.
After he took off his jacket, Klein took quite a bit of effort to buckle up the
holster, which hung close to his left armpit.
“Not bad.” He put on his jacket again.
Old Neil sized him up and nodded in satisfaction.
“It suits you well. My judgment is as accurate as usual.”
After putting away the other items into his pockets and signing the log
book, Klein had a short, casual conversation with Old Neil before leaving.
Halfway, he suddenly he slapped himself in the forehead.
“I forgot to learn more about the Sequences and potions. It’s all the fault of
Emperor Roselle’s diary…”
At this point, he was still unaware of what the first Sequence of the
complete pathway the Church of the Evernight Goddess possessed. All he
knew was that it started with Sequence 9.
Rozanne had apparently mentioned something… The Sleepless? Just as
Klein was slowly walking towards the stairs, a person came down.
He wore tight trousers which made movement easy. His white shirt was not
tucked in, and he had a clear romantic temperament of a poet. He was none
other than the black-haired, green-eyed police inspector who had previously
came to search Klein’s place. They had met upstairs previously, but they
had not exchanged words.
“Good afternoon,” greeted the young poet-like Nighthawk with a smile.
“Good afternoon. I believe I do not need to introduce myself?” answered
Klein humorously.
“There’s no need. I have a deep impression of you.” The young Nighthawk
extended his right hand and said, “Leonard Mitchell. Sequence 8’s
Midnight Poet.”
Sequence 8… He’s really a poet… Klein smilingly shook his hand as he
returned with a question, “You have a deep impression of me?”
Leonard Mitchell’s green eyes were deep as he replied with a very faint
smile. “You have a special disposition.”
He feels and sounds so gay… The corners of Klein’s mouth moved slightly
as he barely said with a smile, “I don’t think so myself.”
“After encountering an accident like that, you remained alive despite not
receiving our protection immediately. That makes you special enough.”
Leonard pointed ahead. “I have to replace Captain. See you tomorrow.”
“See you tomorrow.” Klein turned to make way for the Nighthawk.
As he walked to the ends of the stairwell, Leonard Mitchell suddenly turned
around and stared at the stone-paved ground which was illuminated by the
yellow sunset. He muttered into the air softly, “Did you manage to notice
anything…”
…
“Indeed, there’s nothing special about him…”
