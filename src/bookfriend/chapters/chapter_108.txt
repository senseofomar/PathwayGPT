Chapter 108

: Deep Into The Night
Despite not being dawn yet, the well-ventilated but quiet and dark
underground was illuminated by gas lamps. The dim yellow light emitted
from the gas lamps were protected by glass, allowing them to steadily shine
throughout the empty and quiet tunnel.
Klein sat in the duty room and casually flipped through the newspapers,
magazines, and books piled before him. He directed some of his attention
outside, to prevent anyone from charging inside the Chanis Gate.
His windbreaker and top hat were hung on the clothes rack near the
entrance while his cane was leaning against the wall where it could be
easily retrieved.
The rich aroma of coffee filled the air, and Klein couldn’t help but take a
whiff. He massaged his temples to fight against the heavy head feeling he
was experiencing and the weariness of his body.
As a college student back on Earth, he often slept at five in the morning and
woke up at noon, while staying up all night during the past two to three
years of working life, to the point of being able to attend work energetically
the next day. However, it was all thanks to the games that were too
exhilarating, novels that were too interesting, television shows and movies
that were too entertaining.
This world obviously didn’t possess any of the necessities needed for
staying up all night.
“Seriously, Emperor Roselle. If you want to posture, do it properly. Pour
your limited life into an unlimited enterprise. Lead the people of this world
into the information age!” Klein muttered silently. He could only console
himself that there were at least newspapers, magazines, and increasingly
interesting novels.
At first, he wanted to focus on his studies to restrain his sleepiness.
However, practically speaking, it conflicted with his duty. Once he entered
that state, he would easily overlook any movements outside and any
changes to the situation at the Chanis Gate.
Phew. Klein picked up his coffee cup and carefully blew at it.
He took a sip and let the fragrant taste swish around his mouth before
letting the liquid slowly flow down his throat.
“Fermo Coffee from the Paz Valley, very bitter but very refreshing,” Klein
gave a compliment and put down his coffee cup.
The Paz Valley was located in the Southern Continent, a region that
produced high-quality coffee beans. It was currently being fought over by
the Intis Republic and the Loen Kingdom. They both built colonist
settlements on the left and right banks of the Paz Valley, and had destroyed
the original Paz Kingdom.
In the eerie silence, Klein casually picked up a magazine and realized that it
was Ladies Aesthetic, which talked about fashion and dating.
“This must be from Rozanne…” he murmured in amusement as he flipped
through it with his interest piqued.
Maybe it was due to the sudden advancement of camera technology in the
past decade or so, not only did the magazine use a lot of illustrations, it
even used monochrome pictures as their content—just like the newspapers.
They fashionably invited the famous play and musical actors to model the
charms and the magical pairing of the clothing. In a short span of seven
years, the new regional Backlund magazine became a mainstream magazine
that spread across the nation.
“The dress looks nice, she’s pretty too…” Klein flipped through it casually
and didn’t hide his aesthetic inclinations.
He was a man that had matured normally both in body and mind. He had
always appreciated beautiful ladies, but he had long set his goal—to find a
way home. Hence, he tried his best to keep his distance from the opposite
sex, so that he didn’t waste the other person’s time or leave behind any
emotional baggage.
As for streetwalkers, he was quite a germaphobe in that aspect.
Benson and Melissa were already shackles that couldn’t be removed. He
could only find the means to make it up to them in the future… Klein
suddenly felt his heart heavy and he couldn’t help but let out a sigh.
The further he strayed away from home, the more he felt melancholic
during quiet late nights.
He suddenly lost his interest in looking at beautiful women and put down
the magazine in his hands. He picked up a novel instead.
“Stormwind Mountain Villa, author, Fors Wall,” Klein read the content on
the cover.
The tranquil night, dim yellow light, and the leatherbound book reminded
him of his younger days when he rented books. Hence, he continued to read
simply because of nostalgia.
Stormwind Mountain Villa was a novel about Lady Sissi, who was 1.65
meters tall and weighed ninety-eight pounds. It was a story of her
embarking as a home tutor in the Fruys Mountain Villa.
“One pound is about half a kilogram… Is this Jane Eyre of an alternate
world?” Klein caressed his fingers against the smooth paper as he began
making guesses of the subsequent content.
However, just as he thought it was a romance novel, an evil spirit emerged
in the story. When he believed that it was a ghost story, Lady Sissi revealed
herself as a detective and made a marvelous deduction.
Just as Klein felt that it was definitely a detective novel, the main male
character took a heavy blow to the head and lost his memory. Then, it
became a heart-rending drama.
“… In the end, it’s still a romance book.” Klein closed the book and drank a
mouthful of coffee.
Thump!
Thump! Thump! Thump!
A ferocious knocking was suddenly heard as it reverberated in the dim and
quiet empty corridor.
Klein jumped in shock as he immediately turned tense.
He instinctively drew his revolver from his armpit holster, adjusted the
cylinder and hammer. Then, he slowly walked to the door and looked for
the source of the sound.
Thump! Thump! Thump!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
The thumping became more and more intense. Klein looked in the direction
of the sound and saw the black outward-swinging gates that were engraved
with seven Sacred Emblems.
“Sounds from beyond the Chanis Gate?” He squinted his eyes and his heart
was beating like a drum.
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Klein saw Chanis Gate shake gently, and he sensed the massive impact it
was withstanding.
“It can’t be, right… I’m encountering something on my first day on duty?
Did I get an unlucky constitution after I transmigrated?” Klein’s right hand
broke into cold sweat as it held the revolver.
Very soon, he recalled the Captain’s instruction: do not open Chanis Gate
no matter what you hear, unless it is opened from the inside.
Uh, could this be a normal phenomenon? Klein suddenly calmed down.
Bang! Bang! Bang! Thump! Thump! Thump! The commotion beyond the
Chanis Gate grew in intensity, but the heavy black metal gates only shook.
Otherwise, it didn’t show any unusual signs.
“This is normal. I nearly died from the shock…” Klein muttered, before he
prepared to return to the duty room.
Just then, he heard a sharp grinding noise. He looked at the heavy Chanis
Gate bulging outwards as a crack appeared on in its surface!
Zing!
In the jarring noise, Klein’s almost fixed eyes saw a figure. Its height was
about the length of a man’s arm, and it was wearing a classic, black,
miniaturized regal gown. There was an obvious stain on the gown.
It had a not-so-exquisite face, black eyes, and tightly sealed lips.
It was a cloth puppet, a toy cloth puppet!
At that moment, when Klein was about to subconsciously raised his gun to
take aim, the cloth puppet leaned heavily into the crack in Chanis Gate and
unfurled the paper it was holding.
There were many mysterious symbols on the paper, some that Klein knew
and some that he had yet to learn. Together, they formed a vertical eye!
Klein had yet to understand the situation when the regal-gowned puppet
was suddenly dragged back by a shapeless force to the back of Chanis Gate!
Creak!
Chanis Gate closed once again, with no more knocking or pounding sounds.
The basement regained its tranquility and silence as though nothing had
happened.
“I have to inform Captain that Chanis Gate was opened from the inside…
But it closed itself…” At that moment, Klein’s mental facilities returned to
him as he felt alarm, fear, and doubt.
A few seconds later, he recalled what the cloth puppet was. Since he was an
official member of the Nighthawks, he was given the clearance to know
about the Grade 3 Sealed Artifact sealed behind Chanis Gate.
“Number: 0625.
“Name: Misfortune Cloth Puppet.
“Danger Grade: 3. Considerably dangerous. It has to be used carefully. It
can only be applied for operations that require three or more people.
“Security classification: Official Nighthawk member or above.
“Sealing method: Only needs to be separated from humans.
“Description: The cloth puppet is wearing a regal gown which was popular
in around the year 1300. The gown has a stain that is almost impossible to
remove. It is uncertain if the stain was present from the very beginning.
“In a few tragic cases of individual family financial crises recorded in
Tingen, the police noticed the existence of the puppet. It was always placed
in the children’s bedroom, on the side table next to the bed.
“A few Nighthawks accepted the request and started an investigation on the
puppet.
“The initial evaluation determined that it brought misfortune, causing
people around it to be unlucky and find themselves in danger. Finally, they
would die one after another. It only took two weeks for the tester to reach
the brink of bankruptcy.
“The puppet isn’t equipped with the capability to live. It doesn’t have any
inclinations of escaping the seal.
“Through extended periods of experimentation, we discovered that as long
as one does not come within ten meters of it for more than half an hour a
day, one wouldn’t be tainted with misfortune. If misfortune has befallen
someone, the person will immediately have his situation turn for the better
as long as the misfortune is transferred to another person.
“Appendix: The puppet first appeared in the house of an old lady, Tess, who
lived in the Lower Street of Iron Cross Street. She was a toymaker. Due to
old age and her husband’s severe illness, with both her children passing on
early, she had no choice but to move to the Iron Cross Street’s Lower Street.
“This was the last toy she sold. She exchanged the puppet for some poison
hemlock and ended her and her husband’s lives, having starved for more
than three days.”
As Klein recalled the information of Sealed Artifact 3-0625, he felt even
more doubtful and horrified.
Didn’t it say the puppet isn’t equipped with the capability to live? Didn’t it
say that it doesn’t have any inclinations of escaping the seal?
What did I see just now!?
What dragged it back in the end?
The symbol that was drawn on the paper that it unfurled, what does it
mean?
That scene earlier was like how a psychotic murderer deals with his victim
as the victim slams on the gates heavily and cries for help desperately, only
to be dragged back…
While these thoughts flooded him, Klein decided not to make any decision
on his own.
He returned to the duty room and pulled a rope.
The rope tightened, the gear spun, and there was suddenly a hurried
ringtone that rang on the second floor of the Blackthorn Security Company.
Leonard Mitchell and the other Sleepless who were playing cards in the
entertainment room immediately put down their poker cards and ran to the
basement.
