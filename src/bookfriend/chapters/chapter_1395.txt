Chapter 1395

An Ordinary Person“s Daily Life 1/8
“You Have a Chance to Meet His Holiness.”
Barton Heard a Man in a Dark-blue Bishop Robe Say to Him.
No Matter How Hard He Tried, the Other Man’s Face Was Indiscernible. It
Felt Like His Face Was Covered With a Gray, Blurry Gas.
Of Course, This Wasn’t an Important Matter. As a Devout Believer of the
Lord, It Was Definitely the Greatest Honor for Barton to Meet a Proxy of
“Him.”
This Made Him So Excited That He Couldn’t Say a Word. His Body
Trembled as He Followed the Bishop to the Back, Entering the Hall One
Step at a Time.
Barton Couldn’t Describe the Hall in Detail Either. He Only Knew That It
Was Very Grand and Magnificent, One That Exuded an Immense Pressure.
He Could Only Bow His Head Obediently.
Finally, He Arrived in Front of the Steps.
At That Moment, He Seemed to Receive Permission as He Subconsciously
Raised His Head.
Then, He Saw a Golden Retriever.
This Dog Wore a Deep Blue, Gorgeous Robe That Resembled a Curtain. It
Wore a Papal Tiara With Many Gems Embedded in It. It Sat on a Huge
Throne and Watched Him Quietly.
“…” Barton Was Stunned.
This, This is the Pontiff? Barton Was Shocked and Panicked, a Strong Sense
of Fear Rising in His Heart.
He Opened His Eyes Abruptly and Saw the Morning Light Illuminating the
Ceiling.
Phew… Barton Sat Up, Panting Slightly, Trying to Extricate Himself From
the Influences of the Dream as Quickly as Possible.
“What Happened?” His Wife Sensed Something Amiss and Got Up.
Barton Shook His Head.
“a Nightmare.”
He Didn’t Tell His Wife the Truth—he Dreamed That the Pontiff Was a
Golden Retriever.
He Could Bet That His Wife Would Say in Horror, “How Can You Have
Such Sacrilegious Thoughts?”
If That Were to Happen, He Could Only Shrug His Shoulders and Say, “Just
Kidding.”
I Can’t Bring My Troubles Into My Family Life. This is a Paradise for
Humans, Meant for Relaxing… Moreover, Women Can Hardly Understand
More Profound Questions. They Have Traits in Being Perceptive to
Thoughts, and Love… Barton Didn’t Dwell on the Contents of His Dream
Anymore. He Got Out of Bed and Went to the Bathroom to Brush His
Teeth.
After Breakfast, He Kissed His Wife and Children Before Leaving His
Residence and Taking a Trackless Public Carriage to the Working District at
the Edge of the City.
He Was Under the Employment of the Loen Relic Search and Preservation
Foundation With a Sizable Salary. In Places Like the Capital of East
Chester County, Stoen City, He Was Considered to Be Upper-middle Class.
On the Way, Barton Studied the Streets Outside Out of Boredom.
Due to Not Being Directly Affected by the War, Stoen City Still Retained
Its Former Prosperity. Carriages, Bicycles, Pedestrians, and Wild Dogs
Came and Went; It Was Lively and Noisy.
Barton Was Already Used to Such a Scene. He Didn’t Have Much of an
Impression of It, but the Dream From Last Night Made Him Uncomfortable
Every Time He Saw a Dog on the Street. It Was as if It Was the Incarnation
of the Pontiff, One That He Needed to Bow to and Greet.
“Holy Lord of Storms, Please Forgive Your Penitent Servant.” Barton
Raised His Right Hand, Clenched His Fist, and Gently Struck His Left
Chest.
After a While, He Arrived at the Loen Relic Search and Preservation
Foundation. As He Greeted His Colleagues, He Walked Into His Office.
After Hanging Up His Hat and Coat, Barton Relaxed and Leisurely
Prepared Some Special Black Tea for Himself—he Was Almost Middle-
aged, and His Energy Was Dropping. He Always Hoped to Use a Simpler
Method to Supplement His Body Without Suffering Any Hardship.
After Preparing the Black Tea, Barton Picked Up a Few Newspapers on the
Desk and Wanted to Prep Himself Before Starting Work.
The Economic Situation in Backlund Last Season Has Greatly Improved…
Another Pirate at the Level of King Has Appeared in the Sonia Sea and the
Berserk Sea, Queen of Stars…
Desi Bay Fruits Trade Fair…
After Reading the Newspaper Slowly, Barton Took a Sip of Black Tea and
Started His Work.
A Letter From Vernal? Barton Found a Letter From an Old Friend as He
Examined the Documents on His Table.
He Was an Archaeologist Who Had a Close Relationship With the Loen
Relic Search and Preservation Foundation.
Barton Immediately Took Out a Letter Cutter, Took Out the Letter, and
Read It Seriously.
“My Dear Friend,
“My Students and I Found Some Interesting Ruins in the Mountains of
Sivellaus County. Perhaps They Originated From Refugees From the Fourth
Epoch…
“In That Period of History That We Don’t Know Much About, They Left
the City for Reasons Unbeknown to Us. They Entered the Forests, and
Stopped Interacting With the Outside World Again. They Existed in the
Form of a Tribe…
“They Might Still Be Guarding Something, but It Has Long Been Drowned
Out by Time, Leaving Behind Only Ruins and Corpses…
“My Students and I Will Excavate This Place While Employing
Conservation Practices. We Hope to Find Something More Useful That Can
Help Us Restore the History of the Fourth Epoch. I Wonder if Your
Foundation is Interested in This.
“…Here, I Solemnly Invite You to Send a Team Over to Confirm if Our
Work is Real and Effective…”
Going Into the Mountains… the First Thing That Surfaced in Barton’s Mind
Was Not the Relics or the History, but the Buzzing Mosquitoes, the Humid,
Dark Environment, and the Camp That Became a Temptation to the Wild
Beasts.
He Shook His Head and Picked Up a Pen and Paper. He Prepared to File
This Letter and Send It to His Superiors.
