Chapter 85

: Urgency
The strange, twisted, and obscure fluctuation was short-lived. Shortly
afterwards, Klein even suspected that he was hallucinating.
If he wasn’t considered rather skilled at spiritual perception, it was very
likely that he would’ve written off the abnormality.
Klein frowned as he thought of his sister upstairs. He tightly held onto his
cane as he went around the bathroom and hobbled to the Wood household’s
staircase.
He quickly went upstairs while following the traces with his spiritual
perception before arriving at the living room beside the balcony.
This should be it… Klein mumbled as he raised his hand and tapped twice
on his glabella.
Auras penetrated the walls and the large wooden door before entering his
vision. Most of the colors were ordinary with a blurry outline.
However, one of them in particular was rippling with a sinister dark green
color over its surface that slowly corroded inwards.
Just as I thought, something wasn’t right. Klein wore an usually stern
expression as he reached out with his right hand and removed the silver
chain which was wrapped around his left wrist.
He held the silver chain in his left hand, allowing the topaz to dangle before
him.
When the topaz stopped swinging, he traced the spherical light and chanted
inwardly, “The room before me has danger caused by the supernatural.”
Normally, spirit dowsing was only suitable for divining something that was
related to him or the specific circumstances in a small region around him.
As such, Klein described the chant in very specific manner—the ‘danger’
could affect him and the room was right in front of him.
…
“The room before me has danger caused by the supernatural.”
After repeating the chant seven times, Klein eyes widened as he saw the
topaz rotating in a clockwise motion rapidly.
It was an indication that there was indeed danger caused by the supernatural
inside the room, and it was of considerable danger!
Selena is a mysticism enthusiast. Did something go extremely wrong when
she was dabbling with some sort of ritual? What should I do? Klein
massaged his brows and wrapped the chain around his wrist before
knocking on the door.
Thump! Thump! Thump!
He knocked on the door three times rhythmically and wore an amiable
smile on his face.
The door opened with a creak. Melissa, who was wearing her new dress,
appeared in front of Klein.
“Klein, is something wrong?” The girl didn’t expect her brother to be here,
so she was momentarily surprised.
Klein responded with a smile, without any sign of distress.
“I was just curious since I heard you gals enjoying yourselves.”
“Sorry for disturbing all of you.” Melissa lowered her head in apology,
feeling somewhat embarrassed. “We’re playing with magic mirror
divination. Selena knows a lot and it’s very fun.”
Magic mirror divination… Sis, why don’t you gals play Charlie Charlie
challenge 1or Ouija boards 2 ? Klein shook his head, feeling both peeved
and amused.
He looked behind Melissa and into the living room. He saw Selena with her
beaming smile and deep dimples.
However, in his spirit vision, the wine-red haired girl, who was holding a
silver-coated mirror, was being encroached by the sinister dark green
colors.
As his mind whirled, Klein deliberated over his words and said, “Heh heh, I
won’t be interrupting your game. Ah, right. Where’s Elizabeth? I had
chatted with her over Feysac grammar. She mentioned that she wanted to
ask me some questions.”
“Elizabeth?” Melissa sized her brother up and said in an eccentric tone to
emphasize her words. “She’s only 16.”
Hey, don’t let your imagination go wild! Klein immediately explained, “It’s
a very normal academic discussion. Elizabeth is very interested in history
and ancient languages.”
Melissa took a deep look at her brother before saying, “She’s inside. I’ll
inform her.”
“Alright.” Klein took a step back and moved away from the door.
While watching his sister turn around, he heaved a sigh of relief. Although
it wasn’t the best of reactions, he was thankful that the person in a danger
wasn’t Melissa.
He only waited for about ten seconds before a puzzled Elizabeth walked
out. She asked curiously, “Mr. Moretti, what’s the matter? I never said I was
interested in history and ancient languages…”
At that moment, her sentence was halted by Klein’s stern and solemn
expression. Her nerves tightened as she seemed to sense that something
wasn’t right.
Klein took a few steps diagonally as a gesture for Elizabeth to hide partially
behind the door.
The girl with the chubby baby fat was influenced by the sudden serious
atmosphere so she unknowingly followed.
“As you know, I’m a mysticism enthusiast.” Klein halted and turned
around, speaking directly to the point.
Elizabeth nodded and replied, “Yes, I even believe that you’re an expert at
mysticism.”
“No, I’m only an enthusiast, but this doesn’t stop me from noticing that
your magic mirror divination has turned into a problem,” Klein said with a
heavy tone.
“A problem?” Elizabeth nearly raised her voice as she hurriedly raised her
hands to cover her mouth.
Klein thought for a moment before saying, “I know words alone will make
it difficult for you to believe me. Return to the room and when Selena isn’t
paying attention, steal a glance at the front of the mirror which Selena has
hidden away from all of you.”
“How do you know that she hid the front of the mirror from us?” Elizabeth
blurted out.
According to the information from the Nighthawks, more than ninety
percent of the time, magic mirror divination cases which involve evil share
such similarities… Klein smiled and said, “General knowledge.”
When the doubtful and frightened Elizabeth returned to the room, his
composed smile vanished instantly. His face looked worried.
Even though we’re all in the North Borough, to go from Fania Street to
Zouteland Street will take at least 15 minutes of travel by public carriage.
By the time Captain arrives after making a round trip, the situation might
have deteriorated to a hopeless state… If only Benson and Melissa wasn’t
here… But I can’t deal with those hidden and unknown existences… Do I
have any means to contain it… Right, Selena is a mysticism enthusiast. Her
room definitely has no lack of pure dew, essential oils, herbs, and other
items…
Just as Klein was racking his brains for a solution, Elizabeth sat next to
Selena by using an excuse of discussing something with her.
A girl opposite her sipped a mouthful of red wine, and under the teasing
looks of everyone, despite her blushing, she mustered her courage to ask,
“Can you help me divine when I’ll meet a romantic and handsome
gentleman?”
Selena lightly coughed twice as she rubbed the mirror’s back and said,
“Mirror, mirror, tell me. When will the gentleman in Yonina’s heart
appear?”
After repeating it three times, she picked up the mirror and raised it in front
of her.
Seizing this opportunity, Elizabeth suddenly turned her body and stretched
out her head to take a glance.
According to her expectations, she felt that she would see Selena’s face and
half her face.
However, the only thing she saw was Selena.
The tiny mirror only had Selena, and it was Selena’s entire body!
The mirror was completely pitch-black, with Selena standing in the middle
with a cold expression!
Elizabeth trembled all over as she lunged backward and leaned against the
sofa. She momentarily forgot to breathe.
She involuntarily trembled and without giving an excuse, got up
immediately, stumbling to the door. She didn’t even dare to turn back to
look at the beaming Selena.
“Yonina’s gentleman will appear on the Sunday of the second week, half a
year later…”
Amidst giggles, Elizabeth opened the door and left the room to see Klein
who was standing in the shadows of the wall lamps in his tuxedo and half
top hat.
“Mr. Moretti, I-I…” she stammered in a daze.
Klein calmly smiled.
“Don’t disturb the girls and ladies inside.”
Infected by his smile, Elizabeth calmed down significantly. She extended
her hand and closed the door as she quickly walked over to the wall lamp.
“I saw it. I saw only Selena inside the mirror. A devil-like Selena…” she
whispered hoarsely.
Indeed… Klein’s expression turned serious as he asked in a deep voice.
“Do you know which is Selena’s bedroom? Do you know where her
mysticism items are?”
“There. The mysticism items are in there as well.” Elizabeth didn’t hesitate
to point at a room diagonally across.
Klein held his cane and walked over, opening the unlocked wooden door.
Under the streetlights and the crimson moon’s illumination, he turned a
valve and lit a gas lamp.
A pale yellow light glowed as he swept the area and found bottles of pure
dew, flower essence, boxes of herbal powder, candles and amulets.
These items were placed on tables or neatly arranged inside a rack. Their
names were given on sticker labels.
After confirming the items, Klein said to Elizabeth who had followed
behind him, “Do you want to save Selena?”
“Yes!” Elizabeth subconsciously nodded before asking in a daze, “Will it be
dangerous?”
“A certain amount. After all, I’m only a mysticism enthusiast,” Klein
replied frankly.
“A certain amount of danger…” Elizabeth pursed her lips tightly for a few
seconds before saying, “Is there anything you need from me?”
Klein smiled warmly as he comforted her, “Don’t be nervous. Now, all you
have to do is pretend to return as though nothing had happened. Return to
Selena’s side. Five minutes later—remember—five minutes later, tell
Selena that you have a pleasant surprise and bring her to me. Knock on the
door softly, one long knock and two short ones. Following that, well—leave
it to me.”
Elizabeth thought over it silently before nodding seriously.
“Alright.”
Seeing her return to the living room, Klein glanced at his pocket watch. He
closed Selena’s bedroom and quickly cleared the desk. Then, he picked the
items needed and placed them on a chair.
Immediately following that, he picked up two faint candles with a light
aroma. He placed them on the upper left and right corners of the desk.
They were symbols representing the Lady of Crimson and the Empress of
Disaster and Horror.
Klein planned on holding a ritual here to borrow the Evernight Goddess’s
powers to ward off the mysterious and unknown existence that was
affecting Selena!
As he was only a Sequence 9, the ritualistic magic he knew wasn’t strong
enough. In order to succeed, he needed Elizabeth to lure Selena into a
sealing circle, right in the vicinity of the altar!
Therefore, he needed to consider situations in which Selena might notice
and resist!
Due to these reasons, Klein planned on using suspension-style ritualistic
magic.
