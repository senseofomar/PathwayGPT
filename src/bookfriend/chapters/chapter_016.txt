Chapter 16

: Rat-baiting With Dogs
Phew, I finally got through the round with the medium…
Klein let out a foul breath. He slowly turned around and enjoyed the cool
breeze and tranquility of the night while walking closer and closer to the
apartment building’s door.
He took out his keys, inserted the correct one in and turned it gently,
allowing the crimson-mixed darkness to expand with the creaking sound of
the opened door.
Walking on the staircase without a single person in sight and taking in the
cold air, Klein had an inexplicable and amazing feeling. It felt like he had a
few more hours than others. This caused him to hasten his pace.
In a similar state of mind, he opened the door to his room and before he
even stepped inside, he saw a silhouette sitting silently in front of his desk.
It had reddish black hair, bright brown eyes, and a delicate, pretty face.
Undoubtedly, she was Melissa Moretti!
“Klein, where did you go?” Melissa asked curiously as she relaxed her
eyebrows.
Without waiting for Klein’s reply, she added, “Just now, I got up to go to
the bathroom and realized you weren’t home.” It was as if she wanted to
know everything clearly, from the causes and effects of the matter to the
underlying logic.
With great experience at lying to his parents, Klein’s brain took a spin
before he gave a bitter smile and calmly replied, “I couldn’t fall asleep
again after I woke up. Instead of wasting time, I decided that I should train
my body. So I went out to run a few rounds. Look at my sweat!”
He took off his jacket and half-turned his body, pointing to his back.
Melissa stood up, took a glance half-heartedly and deliberated for a few
moments before saying, “Honestly speaking, Klein, you don’t have to stress
yourself out. I’m sure you can pass the interview to Tingen University.
Even if you can’t, er—I mean if —you can still find better ones.”
I haven’t even thought about the interview… Klein nodded his head and
said, “I understand.”
He did not mention the “offer” that he had gotten because he had not
decided whether he wanted to join them or not.
Staring at Klein intensely, Melissa suddenly turned around and trotted into
the interior of the house. She took out an object that resembled a tortoise. It
was comprised of items like gears, rusted iron, torsion springs and ordinary
springs.
After quickly tightening the torsion spring, Melissa placed the object on the
desk.
Ka! Ka! Ka!
Dum! Dum! Dum!
The “tortoise” moved and jumped with a rhythm that could pull anyone’s
attention.
“Whenever I feel irritated, I feel much better seeing this tortoise move. I’ve
been doing this very often recently and it’s very effective! Klein, give it a
try!” invited Melissa as her eyes brightened.
Klein did not turn down his sister’s goodwill. He approached the “tortoise”
and waited for it to stop before laughing. He said, “Simplicity and
regularity can indeed help relaxation.”
Without waiting for Melissa’s reply, Klein pointed to the “tortoise” and
casually asked, “Did you make this yourself? When did you make this?
Why wasn’t I aware of it?”
“I made use of unwanted materials from school and things picked up from
the streets to make this. It was only finished two days ago,” Melissa said in
her usual tone, the side of her lips upturned a few more degrees.
“That’s impressive,” Klein praised sincerely.
As a boy with poor skills in machine assembly, he encountered great
difficulties even assembling a four-wheel toy car as a child.
With her chin slightly raised and her eyes slightly bent, Melissa calmly
replied, “It was okay.”
“Being overly humble is a bad trait,” Klein smiled slightly and continued,
“This is a tortoise, right?”
Instantly, the atmosphere in the room took a great plunge, leaving behind an
air of graveness for a while. Then, Melissa faintly replied with a voice that
seemed enigmatic like the crimson veil, “It’s a puppet.”
Puppet…
Klein gave an awkward smile, and tried to forcefully explain, “The problem
lies in the materials, they’re too rudimentary.”
Following that, he tried to change the topic and said, “Why would you go to
the bathroom in the middle of the night? Isn’t there a toilet here? Don’t you
always sleep till dawn?”
Melissa was taken aback momentarily.
It was only after a few seconds, before she opened her mouth, prepared to
explain.
At that moment, an intense sound of digestion sounded from
herthoracoabdominal 1 area.
“I-I’ll go get some more sleep!”
Bang! She grabbed her tortoise-like “puppet”, trotted to the interior of the
house, and closed the door to her room.
Last night’s dinner was too good, she ate too much and now her stomach is
having trouble digesting it… Klein shook his head as he smiled, slowly
walking towards his desk. He sat down soundlessly, silently pondering
Dunn Smith’s invitation as the crimson red moon emerged from behind the
dark clouds.
Being a Nighthawk civilian staff member had its apparent disadvantages.
With me being a transmigrator, “The Fool”—initiator of the mysterious
Gathering—and the multiple secrets I have, it will be risky to be under the
noses of the Church of the Evernight Goddess’s team that specializes in
dealing with matters regarding the Beyonders.
As long as I join Dunn Smith and his team, I would certainly aim to become
a Beyonder. I could then cover up the benefits gained from the Gathering.
Yet, becoming a formal member would entail many restrictions on my
freedom, like how a civilian staff has to report his leaving of Tingen. No
longer would I be able to go wherever I want or do whatever I want. I
would miss many opportunities.
The Nighthawks are a strict organization. Once a mission is given, I can
only wait for the arrangements and accept orders. There is no room for
rejection.
Beyonders have the risk of losing control.
…
Having all the disadvantages listed out one by one, Klein turned to
considering the necessities and advantages:
Judging from the situation of the luck enhancement ritual, I’m not one of
the eighty percent of lucky people. In the future, there is bound to be some
bizarre event happening to me, increasing the dangers I face.
Only by becoming one of the Beyonders or by joining the Nighthawks can I
be equipped with the ability to resist.
The wish to become a Beyonder cannot be solely reliant on the Gathering.
The potion formula is not a major problem, but where can I find the
corresponding materials? How am I to obtain and concoct them?
Not forgetting the nous of daily practice, I’m faced with serious obstacles!
It is just not possible for me to consult Justice and The Hanged Man on
every matter and exchange every object with them. This would not only hurt
the image of The Fool and arouse their suspicions, but there will also be
inadequate time to communicate on such trivial issues.
Similarly, I am unable to produce anything that can pique their interest.
Besides, more materials would more often than not leave behind the trail of
my real identity. Then, “online disputes” would effectively be transformed
into “offline conflicts,” bringing about immense troubles.
By joining the Nighthawks, there would definitely be contact with the
common knowledge of the world of mystery and relevant channels. This can
sufficiently accumulate into a corresponding social circle and can be used
as leverage. Only then can I initiate the Gathering and in turn gain the
greatest benefits from Justice and The Hanged Man. In reality, the gains
can feedback into reality, allowing me to obtain more resources and form a
virtuous cycle.
Of course, I could also go to an organization that is suppressed by the
various Churches such as the Psychology Alchemists mentioned by Dunn
and join them.
Yet I’ll also lose my freedom, and be in a constant state of fear and anxiety.
However, more importantly, I have no idea where to look for them. Even if I
manage to gain the corresponding information from The Hanged Man, such
rash contact with them could endanger my life.
Becoming a civilian staff leaves opportunity for a buffer and exit.
The inferior recluse hides away in the wild; the superior, the crowd.
Perhaps the identity as a Nighthawk can be a better cover.
In the future, when I become one of the top authorities of the tribunal, who
would imagine that I am a heretic, the head of the secret organization who
is working behind the scenes?
…
As the first rays of the morning sun shone, the crimson disappeared. Gazing
at the golden light on the horizons of the sky, Klein made up his mind.
He would find Dunn Smith today and become part of the Nighthawk’s
civilian staff!
At this moment, Melissa, who had gotten out of bed again, had pushed open
the door to the room. She was surprised to see her brother stretching in an
unglamorous manner. “You didn’t sleep?”
“I was thinking through some things.” Klein smiled, feeling relaxed.
Melissa thought for a moment and said, “Whenever I encounter problems,
I’ll list out both the pros and cons one by one and compare them. After that,
I would be able to get a hint of what I should do next.”
“That’s a good habit. I did that too,” Klein smiled and replied.
Melissa’s countenance was relaxed, and she did not add more. Holding a
yellowish sheet of paper and her toiletries, she headed to the bathroom.
Not in a hurry to leave after he finished his breakfast and his sister’s
departure, Klein took a good nap. Based on what he knew, nearly all the
pubs were closed in the morning.
At two o’clock in the afternoon, he smoothed the pleats of his silk hat and
handkerchief using a small brush. He also removed the dirt to reestablish
the tidiness.
Thereafter, he wore a suit of formal clothing, just like he was going for an
interview.
Besik Street was a little far, and Klein was afraid that he would miss the
“working hours” of the Nighthawk. Therefore, he did not walk there, but
instead waited for public horse carriage at Iron Cross Street.
In the Loen Kingdom, public horse carriages were placed under two
categories—without track and with track.
The former consisted of a carriage drawn by two horses and could sit
approximately 20 people while taking into account the top of the carriage.
Only a general route existed, without specific stations. It had flexible
operations and could be hailed anywhere unless it was full.
The latter was operated by the Orbital Carriage Company. First, a rail-like
service device was laid on the main street. The horses would move on the
inner lane while the wheels ran on the tracks, making it easier and more
labor-saving. This could thus pull a bigger double-decker carriage that sat
nearly fifty passengers.
However, the only problem was that the route and stations were fixed,
making many places inaccessible.
After ten minutes, the sound of the wheels hitting the tracks approached
from a distance. A double-decker horse carriage stopped in front of the
station at Iron Cross Street.
“To Besik Street,” Klein said to the carriage driver.
“You have to transfer at Champagne Street but when you get there, it takes
about ten minutes to walk to Besik Street,” explained the carriage driver to
Klein, with regards to the route.
“Let’s go to Champagne Street then.” Klein nodded in approval.
“It’s more than four kilometers, four pence”, said a young man with a fair
and clean face, as he extended his hand.
He was a worker responsible for money collection.
“Okay.” Klein fished out four copper coins from his pocket and handed it to
the other party.
He walked up to the carriage and found that there were not many
passengers. Even on the first floor, there were a few empty seats.
“I only have three pence on me now, so I can only walk when I go back…”
Klein pressed his hat down and sat down firmly.
On this floor, the men and women were mostly well-dressed although there
were a few clothed in their work clothes, leisurely reading newspapers.
Almost no one spoke, and it was quite quiet.
Klein shut his eyes and recharged his strength, oblivious to the coming and
going of passengers around him.
Station after station passed until he finally heard the few words
“Champagne Street.”
After alighting the horse carriage, he inquired along the way and soon
reached Besik Street, where he saw the pub with the brownish-yellow
hound logo.
Klein reached out his right hand and gave a forceful push. The heavy door
gradually opened, inundating him with a wave of uproarious noises and an
impetuous heat wave.
Although it was still afternoon, there were already many customers in the
pub. Some were temporary workers, looking for opportunities here, waiting
to be hired. Others were simply idling around, numbing themselves with
alcohol.
The pub was dimly lit. In the center, there were two large iron cages with a
third of its bottom sinking deep into the ground without any gaps.
People held wooden wine cups and surrounded it, sometimes discussing
loudly while laughing, sometimes cursing loudly.
Giving a curious glance, Klein found two dogs caged inside. One was black
and white, similar to the husky found on Earth. The other was wholly black,
with shiny fur, making it look healthy and fierce.
“Do you want to bet? Doug has won eight games in a row!” said a little
man wearing a brown beret, as he neared Klein and pointed to the black
dog.
Bet? Taken aback at first, Klein regained his senses immediately.
“Dog-fighting?”
When he was at Khoy University, those aristocratic and wealthy students
would always ask him contemptuously and curiously, if the boorish workers
and unemployed hooligans enjoyed participating in boxing and gambling at
the pubs.
Besides being able to gamble on boxing and card games, didn’t it also
include cruel and bloody activities like cock-fighting, dog-fighting, and
others?
The short man smirked. “Mister, we’re civilized people. We don’t engage in
such unglamorous activities.”
Having said that, he whispered, “Besides, laws were introduced to ban these
things last year…”
“Then what are y’all betting on?” asked Klein curiously.
“The better hunter.” Just as the short man finished his sentence, a
resounding cacophony sounded.
He turned his head, waved his hands excitedly, and said, “You can’t place a
bet for this round as it has started, wait for the next one then.”
Upon hearing that, Klein tipped his toes, lifted his head, and looked as far
as he could.
He saw two strong men each dragging a sack, coming to the side of the iron
cage and opening the “prison door.” They then dumped the contents of the
sack into the cage.
There were gray and disgusting animals!
Klein tried to identify them carefully before realizing that they were rats.
Hundreds of rats!
As the iron cage was deep underground without any gaps, the rats moved in
all directions but could not find a way out.
Right then, just as the door of the cage was closed, the chain of the two
dogs were untied.
“Woof!” The black dog pounced ahead and killed a rat in one bite.
The black-and-white dog was dazed at first before it started playing
excitedly with the rats.
The surrounding people either raised their wine cups and intensified their
gaze or shouted loudly, “Bite it! Kill it!”
“Doug, Doug!”
Motherf**king rat-baiting with dogs 2 … Klein regained his senses and the
corner of his mouth twitched unceasingly.
The objective of the gamble is to determine which dog can catch more
rats…
Perhaps, one can even bet on the specific number of rats caught…
No wonder there were people purchasing live rats at Iron Cross Street…
That’s really unique…
Klein shook his head, laughing as he backtracked, and circled along the
edge of the alcoholic customers, and reached the front of the bar.
“New here?” said the bartender as he spared Klein a glance while wiping
the cups. He continued, “One cup of rye beer is a penny. Enmat beer, costs
two pence. Four pence for Southville beer, or do you want a cup of purely
brewed malt Lanti?”
“I came here for Mr. Wright,” said Klein directly and bluntly.
The bartender whistled and shouted to the side, “Old Man, someone is
looking for you.”
“Oh, who…” A vague voice sounded, and an intoxicated old man stood up
from behind the bar.
He rubbed his eyes, shifted his gaze to Klein and asked, “Lad, were you
looking for me?”
“Mr. Wright, I would like to hire a small mercenary squad for a mission,”
replied Klein, according to what Dunn had instructed.
“A small mercenary squad? Are you living in an adventure story? This
hasn’t been around for a long time!” the bartender interrupted and smiled.
Wright went silent for a few second before saying, “Who told you to look
for it here?”
“Dunn. Dunn Smith,” replied Klein in all honesty.
Instantly, Wright broke out in a chuckle and replied, “I see. Actually, the
small mercenary squad still exists. It’s just in another form, with a more
contemporary name. You can find it on the second floor of No. 36
Zouteland Street.”
“Thank you,” thanked Klein sincerely before he turned and squeezed out of
the pub.
Before he went out the pub, the alcoholic customers who surrounded him
suddenly quieted down, as they murmured, “Doug was actually defeated…”
“Defeated…”
Klein smiled and shook his head. Then he left quickly and found his way to
the nearby Zoeterland Street after asking around.
“30, 32, 34… Here,” he counted the house numbers and walked into the
stairwell.
Going around the corner and slowly climbing up the stairs, he saw the
vertical sign with the current name of the so-called small mercenary squad.
“Blackthorn Security Company.”
