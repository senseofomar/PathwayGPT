Chapter 29

: "Jobs" and Rentals Are Serious
Business
Klein tried his best to remain his usual self as he asked with genuine
interest, “What abilities do Seers have?”
“Your question is inaccurate; the question should be, ‘what abilities does
consuming the Seer potion give?'” Dunn Smith shook his head and
chuckled. His gray pupils and face turned away from the moon as his
features hid in the shadows. “There are many kinds of things involved—
astromancy, cartomancy, spiritual pendulums, and scrying. Of course, it
does not mean that consuming the potion will immediately allow you to
grasp all of them. The potion only equips you with the qualifications and
ability to learn it.
“As they lack direct means of fighting enemies, heh. You can probably
imagine that setting up a magical ritual requires a lot of preparation. It’s not
suitable for combat. Therefore, in terms of knowledge of mysticism, a Seer
will be more learned and professional than a Mystery Pryer.”
It sounds like it matches my requirements as well… However, the lack of
means to directly deal with enemies is quite a dilemma… Furthermore, the
Church of the Evernight Goddess likely doesn’t have the subsequent
Sequences… The Holy Cathedral likely refers to the headquarters, the
Cathedral of Serenity… The means available to low-Sequence Beyonders
against their enemies might not be comparable to firearms… Klein fell into
deep thought as he racked his brains. He kept going back and forth between
Mystery Pryers and Seers. He no longer considered Corpse Collector.
Dunn Smith smiled when he saw this.
“You don’t have to rush into a decision. Tell me your answer Monday
morning. Regardless of your choice of Sequence or giving up this
opportunity, none of us from the Nighthawks would have any other
thoughts on the matter.
“Calm down and ask your heart.”
With that said, he took off his hat and bowed slightly. He slowly walked
past Klein and headed for the stairwell.
Klein did not say a word and did not immediately reply. He silently bowed
and watched as Dunn left.
Although he was constantly hoping to become a Beyonder previously, he
was thrown into a dilemma when the opportunity arose; the subsequent
missing Sequences, Beyonders having the risk of losing control, the
believability of Emperor Roselle’s diaries, and the illusory murmurs that
could corrupt people into madness all mixed together and formed a moat
that obstructed his advancement.
He took a deep breath and slowly breathed out.
“No matter how bad it is, it can’t be worse than making an eighteen-year-
old high-school student decide on his future career…” Klein gave a self-
deprecating chuckle. Gathering his scattered thoughts, his opened the door
softly and laid back on the bed.
He laid there with his eyes open, silently looking at the bottom of the top
bunk that was dyed with the faint crimson of the moon.
A drunkard staggered outside the window as a carriage sped down the
empty streets. These noises did not break the serenity of the night but
instead made it even darker and more distant.
Klein’s emotions settled down as he recalled his past on Earth. He recalled
how he liked exercising, his father who always spoke loudly, his mother
who enjoyed busying herself despite having a chronic disease, his friends
who grew up with him, going from playing sports like soccer and basketball
to games and mahjong, as well as the person he made a failed confession
to… These were like a silent river; it did not have many ripples or deep
sentimental feelings, but it silently drowned his heart.
Perhaps one will only learn to cherish things after they have lost them.
When the crimson receded and the sky turned golden-yellow from the
flaming ball’s illumination, Klein had made his choice.
…
He got out of bed and headed to the public bathroom to wash his face to
wake himself up. Then, he took a one-soli note to Mrs. Wendy’s to buy
eight pounds of rye bread with nine pence, replenishing the staple food that
had been consumed the previous night.
“The price of bread has begun stabilizing…” He commented after breakfast
as Benson changed.
It was Sunday, so both he and Melissa finally had the chance to rest.
Klein, who was already in proper attire, was sitting on a chair and flipping
through the outdated newspapers he brought back from yesterday. He said
in surprise, “There’s a house for rent here: North Borough’s 3 Wendel
Street, a bungalow with two floors. There are six bedrooms, three
bathrooms, and two big balconies upstairs. Downstairs, there’s a dining
hall, a living room, a kitchen, two bathrooms, and two guest rooms, as well
as an underground cellar… In front of the house are two acres of private
land and there’s a small garden behind. It can be rented for one, two, or
three years, with a weekly rent of one pound six soli. Those interested can
head to Champagne Street and look for Mr. Gusev.”
“That’s our goal for the future.” Benson wore his black halved top hat as he
smiled to say, “The rent for the places in newspapers is usually a little too
expensive. The Tingen City Housing Improvement Company has options
that do not pale in comparison to that for cheaper.”
“Why are we not searching in the Tingen Housing Improvement
Association for the Working Class?” Melissa walked out from her room
holding an old, veiled hat. She had changed into a grayish-white long dress
that had been mended several times.
She was silent and introverted, but that could not mask her youthfulness.
Benson laughed.
“Where did you hear of the Tingen Housing Improvement Association for
the Working Class?” Jenny? Mrs. Rochelle? Or is it from your good friend
Selena?”
Melissa looked to the side and whispered a reply.
“Mrs. Rochelle… While washing up last night, I happened to meet her. She
asked me about Klein’s interview and I told her roughly what happened.
Then, she suggested I find the Tingen Housing Improvement Association
for the Working Class.”
Benson noticed Klein’s puzzled expression and shook his head in
amusement.
“They are targeted at the poor. Well, a precise description is that they are a
housing association for the lower strata of society. They build and renovate
houses that basically have communal bathrooms. They only provide three
choices—a single, double or triple bedroom. Do you wish to continue living
in such an environment?
“The Tingen City Housing Improvement Company share similar businesses
as them, but they also provide choices for the lower-middle class. To be
honest, we are a little better than lower-middle class, but we still quite
worse off than true middle-class families. It’s not a matter of salary; it’s just
that we did not have the time to save up.”
Klein came to a realization as he put away the newspaper. Picking up his
top hat, he stood up.
“Then, let’s set off.”
“I remember that the Tingen City Housing Improvement Company is on
Daffodil Street,” Benson said as he opened the door. “They are like the
Tingen Housing Improvement Association for the Working Class, known as
Five Percent Charities. Do you know why?”
“I don’t know.” Klein raised his cane and walked to Melissa’s side.
The girl with black hair that reached down her back nodded.
Benson headed out and said, “These kinds of housing improvement
associations or companies were established as a result of Backlund. They
are funded in three ways: One, by requesting donations from charitable
foundations. Two, through funding proposals. They receive grants from the
government’s commission at a special rate of 4%. Third, through
investments. By taking a portion of the rent received, they will give their
investors 5% returns. That’s why they are called Five Percent Charities.”
The siblings went down the stairs and slowly walked toward Daffodil
Street. They decided to confirm a place before talking to their present
landlord, Mr. Franky. They did not want to be in a situation where they
were forced to move when had no place to stay.
“I heard from Selena that there are housing improvement companies that
are purely run as charities?” Melissa asked in thought.
Benson chuckled.
“There are, such as the Deweyville Trust which Sir Deweyville donated
money to establish. He builds apartments targeted for the working class. He
also provides dedicated estate management personnel while only charging
rather low rent. However, the criteria for applying is very strict.”
“It sounds like you aren’t fond of the idea?” Klein acutely sensed it as he
asked with a smile.
“No, I respect Sir Deweyville a lot, but I’m certain he does not know what
true poverty is. Staying in his apartment is like a priest giving hope. It’s not
very pragmatic. For instance, tenants have to receive the main vaccines and
they have to take turns cleaning the bathroom. They are unable to sublease
their apartments or use it for commercial activities. They aren’t allowed to
throw their rubbish wantonly and children are prevented from playing in the
corridors. Goddess, does he wish to make everyone ladies and gentlemen?”
Benson answered in his usual tone.
Klein creased his brows in doubt.
“Doesn’t sound problematic. Those are all very reasonable criteria.”
“Yeah.” Melissa nodded in agreement.
Benson cocked his head and looked at them before chuckling.
“Perhaps I have protected the both of you too well that you have not seen
actual poverty. Do you think they would have the money for the main
vaccines? The line for free charitable organization sets them back three
months.
“Do you think their work is stable and not temporary? If they cannot sublet
parts of their apartment to receive some extra income, are they to move out
when they lose their jobs? Besides, many ladies mend clothes or make
match boxes at home to maintain their livelihood. Those are included as
commercial activities. Are you going to chase them all out?
“Most of the poor use all their efforts to survive. Do you think they have the
time to discipline their children and stop them from running along the
corridors? Perhaps they can only be locked at home until they’re old
enough, then sending them to places that accept child labor when they are
around seven or eight years old.”
Ben did not use many adjectives to describe the matter; it caused Klein to
shudder a little.
This was how people from low socioeconomic classes lived?
Beside him, Melissa fell into silence. It took a long while before she said in
an ethereal tone,
“Jenny no longer wished for me to visit her after she moved to the Lower
Street.”
“Let’s hope her father gets back on his feet after that injury and finds a
stable job. However, I have seen too many alcoholics use alcohol to numb
themselves…” Benson laughed with a somber tone.
Klein was at a loss for words. Melissa seemed to be the same. As such, the
siblings walked silently down Daffodil Street and found Tingen City
Housing Improvement Company.
The person who served them was a middle-aged man with an amiable
smile. He did not wear a formal attire or a hat, but instead, wore a white
shirt and black vest.
“You can call me Scarter. Might I know what kind of house you have in
mind?” When he caught a glance at Klein’s silver-inlaid cane, his smile
widened.
Klein looked at Benson, who was better with words, and gestured for him to
answer.
Benson directly answered, “A terrace house.”
Scarter flipped through the files and documents in his hand before smiling.
“There are currently five that haven’t been rented out. To be honest, we are
geared more to serving customers—laborers and their children who have
housing difficulties where six, eight, or even ten or twelve people squeeze
into a house. There aren’t many terrace houses. There’s one at 2 Daffodil
Street, one in the North Borough, one in the East Borough… The weekly
rent goes from 12 to 16 soli. You can take a look at the detailed
introductions here.”
He handed over a document to Benson, Klein, and Melissa.
After reading through it, the siblings exchanged looks and pointed to the
same spot on the piece of paper simultaneously.
“Let’s take a look at 2 Daffodil Street first,” said Benson. Klein and Melissa
nodded in response.
This place was a district they were familiar with.
