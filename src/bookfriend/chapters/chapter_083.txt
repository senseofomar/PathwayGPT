Chapter 83

: Carving
Holding onto the yellowish-brown paper bag full of herbs, Bogda staggered
out of the Lawson’s Folk Herb Store.
While waiting for a tracked carriage, he suddenly came to a realization.
He had spent ten pounds to buy a bag of stuff?
This was nearly a month’s salary for him!
If it wasn’t for his trust in Anna and Joyce, he wouldn’t have brought that
much cash to the Divination Club!
Could it be that the reason why Mr. Moretti only accepted eight pence for
his divination, had something to do with his collusion with the boss of
Lawson’s Folk Herb Store, so as to earn more? This was a classic scam
written on the papers! When Bogda made this connection, he even began to
suspect Klein a little. He even began suspecting Joyce and Anna.
When a tracked carriage stopped in front of him, he looked at the herbs in
his hand. Unable to bring himself to return, he entered the carriage with a
heavy heart.
…
Inside Lawson’s Folk Herb Store.
As the boss watched Bogda leave, he suddenly turned his head and shouted
at the door where there was a pile of herbs, “Scharmaine, stop purchasing
herbs from today.”
“W-why, Master?” A handsome-looking youth with disheveled hair walked
out.
The boss smiled and said, “This is the sixteenth customer that has come
because of my fame. If this carries on, I believe the Nighthawks, the
Machinery Hivemind, and the Mandated Punishers will notice me. When
the time comes, I’ll need to consider heading to other cities.”
“Then, do we need to sublease this store?” Scharmaine nodded in
understanding as he asked with concern.
The boss chuckled.
“If you wish to stay, you can be the boss of this store. You are already
capable at identifying herbs and concocting medicine. Of course, remember
to deposit half of your monthly profits into my anonymous Backlund Bank
account.”
“But, I haven’t learned what you are really good at.” Scharmaine was
already sick of never staying in a city for more than a year, but he was
unwilling to give up learning the magical formulas that his master was good
at.
The boss leisurely rocked himself in his seat.
“That’s not something you can learn just because you want to…”
…
A blackish-green bubbling liquid appeared in front of Bogda’s eyes. It
smelled of stinking socks and the color that makes one want to puke made
him deeply suspicious about everything he had done today.
When the rooster blood was dropped into the medicine, Bogda’s father
looked at his son worriedly and said, “I think surgery is the best option.”
The few drops of rooster blood bubbled with the boiling liquid before
vanishing. Bogda took a deep breath and said, “If this medicine is useless,
I’ll consider surgery.”
“The Lord will watch over you.” Bogda’s father gestured a triangular
Sacred Emblem across his chest.
By the time the boiling liquid had cooled down, Bogda had no intention of
wasting the ten pounds. He raised his right hand and closed his eyes.
Flicking his head back, he gulped down the medicine in one go.
The pungent aroma that had the noxious smell of blood, swished around in
his mouth as he nearly spat out everything he had just drank.
That night, Bogda had an upset stomach. He went to the bathroom six
times, and by the time the crimson moon vanished, he fell asleep groggily.
After an unknown period of time had passed, he jolted awake, having
dreamed that he was being reprimanded by his boss at work.
“Thankfully, I took three days of annual leave. I don’t have to rush to
work.” Bogda heaved a sigh of relief when he discovered that he felt a lot
more spirited.
This was in stark contrast to the sluggish state he was in for the past few
weeks.
Bogda subconsciously reached out and pressed the right side of his
abdomen. He noticed that the region which previously hurt when under
slight pressure felt normal. He only felt the pain from ordinary pressure.
“Don’t tell me it was really effective? That apothecary was clearly just
fooling me…” Bogda was both surprised and doubtful as he got out of bed.
He stretched himself and felt his health returning to him.
He fell silent for a very long while as he muttered, “According to the
apothecary, I still need to drink it twice. Once I’m done drinking, I’ll go to
the hospital to get a check up from a doctor…
“That apothecary didn’t tell me how many times I can drink a day…
“…I still think he’s a cheat…”
…
Inside the civilian staff office of the Blackthorn Security Company, from his
prior request, Klein received a space where no one would disturb him.
He held a carving knife and emitted his spirituality. He seriously carved the
incantations and symbols onto two silver accessories.
The incantation was a request to avoid disaster and was written in Hermes.
The two mysticism symbols symbolized the Evernight Goddess as well as
the Empress of Disaster and Horror.
Aside from that, Klein also added the Path Number that corresponded to the
Goddess, 7, and the magical characteristic.
In addition to that, charms and amulets had to be engraved on both sides;
and each side’s symbols, incantations, and characteristics, their exact
locations, or special formats was in the realm of mysticism. The ones that
were spread amongst the ordinary populace were filled with mistakes.
At that moment, Klein had a lot of damaged materials to his right. Through
repeated practise, and only after he confirmed that he had enough practice,
did he dare to begin creating the amulets for Benson and Melissa.
As he calmed his mind, his spirituality spewed out from the tip of the
carving knife. The number 7 appeared on the surface of the silver
accessories.
He had already finished carving the incantations and symbols on the other
side of the accessory. All that was left was to finish the remaining side.
After putting down his knife, all his spirituality chained together as Klein
suddenly felt a strange, majestic, and terrifying energy surge throughout the
room.
The commotion quickly vanished as the incantations on both sides of the
accessory became complete with Klein’s Spirit Vision. It emitted a serene
blackness.
He put down his carving knife and gently polished the silver accessory that
was formed from a circle and a vertical piece. He felt a tinge of coolness
from the mild-to-the-touch surface.
“It’s done!” He happily placed the finished amulet and another one that he
had previously finished into his pocket, planning to find an opportunity to
give it to Benson and Melissa.
Amulets created by Beyonders possessed a certain level of effectiveness.
They allowed the wearer to unknowingly avoid disasters to a certain extent,
but it was nothing too ridiculous. Furthermore, their spirituality would wane
bit by bit. Unless one used a high-level ritualistic magic and created a
prayer set, a year was the maximum one could use them for. As for high-
level ritualistic magic, there was a terrifyingly high spirituality requirement.
It wasn’t something Klein could endure at the moment.
When the time comes, I can use my spirituality to make another one… Klein
thought, nodding as he began tidying up the messy table.
He didn’t make one for himself for the moment, because an amulet of that
level had limited effects on him. Therefore, his goal was to gain a deeper
understanding of incantations before trying to pair it with ritualistic magic.
That way he could create a few defensive amulets that could be activated
specifically with sound.
After everything was finished, Klein walked out the office and prepared to
hand over the damaged materials. That was when he saw Captain Dunn
walk over in his black windbreaker.
Dunn’s deep and gray eyes swept across him as he smiled.
“Klein, the Holy Cathedral has approved it. You’re now an official
member.”
“Really? That’s great!” Klein expressed his delight.
Dunn nodded and said with a smile, “You can now receive a make-up pay
of three pounds for this week. You’ll receive 4.50 pounds every subsequent
week until the advance payment is cleared.
“By the way, did I mention the Nighthawks’ ritual?
“Every official Nighthawk has to independently complete a mission. Only
by doing so will you gain the recognition of your partners. In consideration
of the outstanding performance you showed, I believe I can assign you an
ordinary mission instead. When that happens, I’ll formally introduce you to
all the Nighthawks in Tingen City.”
Klein replied without hesitation, “Alright!”
Three pounds plus his compensation of seven pounds. Getting a new suit
wasn’t a problem anymore!
Furthermore, he would still have plenty left over!
Well, who knows when my mission will arrive…
Klein waited all the way till Sunday, the day of Selena’s birthday banquet.
…
Changing into his formal suit and using a brush and handkerchief to tidy his
half top hat, Klein looked himself in the mirror before walking over to the
first floor in satisfaction.
At that moment, Melissa was sizing up Benson’s clothes.
“Is there a problem?” Benson raised his cane, feeling a little lacking due to
his sister’s gaze.
He felt that there was nothing wrong with him when he inspected himself.
He was already dressed quite decently.
Melissa stopped staring at him and said with a serious expression, “Benson,
that is a very old suit you’re wearing.”
“There will be a lot of excellent ladies and madams participating in today’s
birthday banquet. I believe that by wearing that, it’ll be a form of disrespect
to them.”
Klein was originally filled with questions. However, when he heard
Melissa’s emphasis, he immediately realized what was happening. He went
over with a chuckle and said, “Benson and I share a similar build. He can
wear my other tuxedo.”
He had already informed his siblings about buying a new suit. He explained
it away by saying that his clothes had been torn while inspecting certain
objects. Therefore, the company generously compensated him. Of course,
he concealed the matter of him being “promoted with a pay rise.” He was
afraid of scaring them and only planned to tell them after half a year.
Such an explanation made Blackthorn Security Company and Melissa
extremely envious. They felt that the Blackthorn Security Company was an
impeccable employer.
“There’s no need to, right?” Benson retorted, having not realized the gravity
of the situation.
“No, it’s extremely important.” Klein pushed Benson’s shoulders up the
stairs. “My tuxedo is hanging on the clothes rack.”
After watching Benson go up the stairs in a daze, Klein turned around and
smiled at Melissa.
“Are you hoping that Benson will use the opportunity provided by Selena’s
birthday banquet to begin a beautiful new romance?”
He had been reading quite a fair amount of newspapers and magazines
recently. He knew that aristocrats and middle-class banquets were typically
grounds for blind dates.
Melissa nodded solemnly.
“Yes, Benson has missed out too much because of us.”
Sis, why are you like a mother… Klein looked at Melissa as he suddenly
shook his head with an exasperated laugh.
