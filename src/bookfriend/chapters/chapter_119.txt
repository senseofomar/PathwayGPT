Chapter 119

: The True Lower Street
Tingen City, 2 Daffodil Street.
Klein, who had left a note, locked the door and walked briskly towards
Leonard Mitchell who was waiting by the side of the road.
Leonard’s short black hair had grown a little over the month, and the lack of
any grooming made it look messy.
Despite that, his messy hair still complimented his decent looks, emerald-
colored eyes, and poetic vibes. It exuded a different sense of beauty.
Indeed, any hairstyle depends on the face… Klein lampooned inwardly. He
pointed in the direction of Iron Cross Street and asked, “Is Frye waiting for
us there?”
“Yes.” Leonard smoothed his untucked shirt and said casually, “Did you
notice any clues when you were looking at the documents?”
Klein held his cane in his left hand as he walked along the side of the road
and said, “No, I cannot find anything common in their times, locations, or
causes of death. You should know that any rituals involving evil gods or
devils must be conducted within a certain time frame or using a special
method.”
Leonard touched the custom-made revolver hidden underneath his shirt, by
his waist and chuckled.
“That isn’t an absolute rule. In my experience, some evil gods or devils are
easily satisfied, as long as they have a particular interest in what is being
asked of them.
“Also, a good number of the deaths seem normal. We have to omit them
before we can arrive at the real answer.”
Klein glanced at him and said, “That’s why the Captain asked us to
investigate once more. To eliminate the normal incidents.”
“Leonard, your tone and description tell me that you have considerable
experience in this area, but you have only been a member of the
Nighthawks for four years, with an average of two supernatural incidents a
month. Furthermore, a large number of those were simple and easy to
solve.”
He always felt that Leonard Mitchell was a little weird and mysterious. Not
only was he always suspicious of him, believing that there was something
about him. In addition, his demeanor also changed from time to time,
sometimes quiet, sometimes arrogant, sometimes flippant, sometimes staid.
“Could it be that you’ve also had a fortuitous encounter? An encounter that
makes you view yourself as a star in a play?” Klein made a rough deduction
based on all the movies, novels, and dramas he had watched in the past.
Upon hearing this question, Leonard laughed and said, “That’s because
you’re not a full-fledged Nighthawk yet. You’re still in the training phase.
“The Holy Cathedral compiles a record of all supernatural encounters
experienced by cathedrals of the different dioceses and hands it down to its
members once every six months.
“Aside from your mysticism lessons, you can submit an application to the
Captain and request to enter Chanis Gate to read these records.”
Klein nodded in enlightenment.
“The Captain has never mentioned this to me.”
Klein hadn’t had the opportunity to enter Chanis Gate up to this point.
Leonard chuckled and said, “I thought that you were already used to the
Captain’s style. To think that you are still naively waiting for him to remind
you…”
Upon saying that, he added meaningfully, “We must be cautious of the
Captain if there ever comes a day when he remembers everything.”
Would that mean a loss of control? Klein nodded, his expression serious. He
then asked, “Is the forgetfulness unique to the Captain? I had thought that it
was a problem brought about by the Sleepless Sequence.”
Burning the midnight oil usually leads to memory loss…
“More accurately, it’s a symptom unique to a Nightmare. With dreams and
reality intertwined, it’s often hard for a person to differentiate between what
is real and what isn’t. They need to remember what isn’t part of reality…”
Leonard wanted to elaborate further, but they had already arrived at Iron
Cross Street and found Corpse Collector Frye waiting for them at the public
carriage station.
Frye was wearing a round black hat and a windbreaker of a similar color
with a leather briefcase in his hand. He was so pale that it made Klein
suspect if he would soon collapse at anytime. His icy aura made everyone
else waiting for the carriage keep their distance from him.
After nodding to each other, the three grouped up silently and walked past
the Smyrin Bakery before turning onto the Lower Street of Iron Cross
Street.
They were immediately faced with a din. Merchants selling clam soup,
seared fish, ginger beer, and fruits were shouting hysterically for attention,
causing the pedestrians to involuntarily slow down.
It was already a little past five. People were returning to Iron Cross Street,
and the sides of the streets were becoming crowded. Some children were
mixed in the crowd, coldly watching everything, placing their attention on
the pockets of the pedestrians.
Klein frequently came here for cheap cooked food and was familiar with
the streets, especially since he had lived in a nearby apartment in the past.
He reminded the group, “Be careful of thieves.”
Leonard smiled. “You need not mind them.”
He pulled on his shirt and adjusted the holster of his gun, revealing his
revolver.
Suddenly, all the gazes fixed on them shifted away. The pedestrians around
them instinctively made way.
Klein froze for a moment, then caught up to Leonard and Frye with large
steps. He lowered his head, trying hard to avoid being noticed by anyone he
knew.
Benson and Melissa still had dealings with the neighbors here. After all,
they hadn’t moved too far away.
The three made their way past the area that was had many peddlers and
turned into the true Lower Street of Iron Cross Street.
The pedestrians here were all dressed in old, ragged clothes. They were
cautious of strangers wearing bright and beautiful clothes; yet, there was
also greed in their eyes, like vultures eyeing a meal, waiting to strike at any
time. But Leonard’s revolver prevented any accidents from happening.
“Let’s first investigate the death from yesterday. We’ll begin with Mrs.
Lauwis, a lady who glued matchboxes together for a living.” Leonard
flipped his notes and pointed to a place not far away, “First floor, No.
134…”
As the three of them walked forward, children who were playing in the
streets and dressed in shabby clothes quickly hid by the corner of the road.
They observed them with eyes full of curiosity and fear.
“Look at their arms and legs, thin as matchsticks.” Leonard sighed. He
entered building No. 134 first.
Air that was a mixture of numerous scents entered Klein’s nostrils. He
could faintly detect the stench of urine, sweat, and mold, as well as the
smell of burning coal.
Klein couldn’t help but pinch his nose. He then saw Bitsch Mountbatten
who had been waiting there for them.
Officer Mountbatten had a brownish-yellow mustache and was envious of
Leonard’s rank of inspector.
“Sir, I have already asked Lauwis to wait in her room,” Bitsch Mountbatten
said with his unique, shrill voice.
He clearly didn’t recognize Klein, who now looked more energized and
proper. All he cared about was sucking up to the three officers in front of
him as he led them to the Lauwis family on the first floor.
It was a simple apartment. There was a bunk bed laid upright inside the
room and a desk filled with glue and hard paper on the right side. The
corner of the room was piled full of frames for matchboxes, while an old
cabinet sat on the left, acting as a storage space for both clothes and cutlery.
A stove, toilet, and a small amount of coal and timber occupied the two
sides of the door, while the center of the room was occupied by two dirty
mattresses. A man was sleeping under a torn blanket, leaving no space for
anyone to walk.
A lady lay on the lower level of the bunk bed, her skin ice cold. It was clear
that she had lost all signs of life.
Beside the corpse sat a man in his thirties. He had oily hair, looked
dispirited, and his eyes had lost their luster.
“Lauwis, these three officers are here to examine the body and ask you
questions,” Bitsch Mountbatten shouted, without any regard for the sleeping
man.
The dispirited man looked up weakly and asked in surprise, “Didn’t
someone already examine the corpse and question me?”
He was dressed in a grayish-blue worker’s uniform which had visible signs
of being mended multiple times.
“Answer when I tell you to! Why do you have so many questions?” Bitsch
Mountbatten berated the man, then turned to Leonard, Klein, and Frye.
“Officers, this is Lauwis. The person on the bed is his wife, who is also the
deceased. According to our preliminary analysis, she died from a sudden
illness.”
Klein and the rest tiptoed to the edge of the bed.
The high-nosed, thin-lipped Frye did not say anything with his cold
demeanor. Instead, he patted Lauwis gently, signaling for the man to make
way so that he could examine the body.
Klein looked at the sleeping man and asked, “This is?”
“M-my tenant.” Lauwis rubbed his forehead as he said, “The rent for this
room is three soli ten pence a week. I’m only a worker at the harbor, and
my wife made two and a quarter pence per crate of glued matchboxes. Each
crate h-has, up to 130 boxes. We, we also have a child. We can only rent the
rest of the space to someone else. We only charge a soli a week for the
mattress…”
“I have a tenant who’s helping out at the theater, and he’s not back before
10 at night. He sold his rights to the mattress in the daytime to t-this man.
He’s the person who watches over the gate of the theater at night, so he only
pays six pence every week…”
Hearing the other party stammer as he explained, Klein couldn’t help but
look at the crate in the corner of the room.
One crate had 130 matchboxes and only earned them 2.25 pence, about the
cost of two pounds of black bread… How many crates could she manage a
day 1 ?
Leonard surveyed the surroundings and asked, “Was your wife acting
abnormally prior to her death?”
Lauwis, who had been asked similar questions, pointed to the left side of his
left chest and said, “From last week, well—perhaps the week before, she
said that she felt stuffy in this area and couldn’t catch her breath.”
The precursor to a heart condition? A normal death? Klein interrupted,
“Did you see how she died?”
Lauwis recalled, “She stopped working after sunset. Candles and gas are
more expensive than matchboxes… She said that she was very tired and
asked me to talk to the kids and let her rest. When I saw her again, she had
a-already stopped breathing.”
Lauwis could no longer hide his grief and pain when he said that.
Klein and Leonard asked several questions, but could not find anything
unnatural about the death.
After they looked at each other, Leonard said, “Mr. Lauwis, please wait
outside for a few minutes. We are going to conduct a thorough examination
of the corpse. I don’t think that you’ll want to see that.”
“Alright.” Lauwis stood up anxiously.
Bitsch Mountbatten walked toward the mattress and kicked the tenant,
violently chasing him out of the apartment. He then closed the door and
guarded the room from the outside.
“So?” Leonard looked at Frye.
“She died of a heart attack,” Frye said with certainty, retracting his hands.
Klein thought for a moment before taking out a half-penny, intending to do
a quick judgment.
“Mrs. Lauwis’s heart attack was due to supernatural causes?” No, that is
too narrow, the answer might be misleading… Hmm, “There are
supernatural factors influencing Mrs Lauwis’s death.” I’ll use that! He
quickly decided on a statement.
As he recited the statement, Klein made his way to the side of Mrs Lauwis’s
corpse. His eyes turned darker as he tossed the coin.
The sound of the coin reverberated around the room as it fell, straight into
Klein’s palm.
This time, the portrait of the king was facing up.
This meant that there were supernatural factors influencing Mrs. Lauwis’s
death!
