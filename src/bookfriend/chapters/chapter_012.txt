Chapter 12

: Here Again
Melissa, can you not rub my nose in it… Klein muttered inwardly. He felt a
throbbing pain in his head.
The amount of content Klein had forgotten was considered a lot, but neither
was it negligible. The interview was in two days, so how could he find the
time to make up for it…?
Furthermore, he was involved in such strange paranormal activity, so how
would it be possible that he would be in the mood to revise?
Klein gave his sister a perfunctory response and began putting on the
appearance of studying. Melissa moved a chair over to sit beside him. With
light shining from the gas lamp, she began working on her assignments.
The atmosphere was serene. When it was almost eleven o’clock, the
siblings bade each other goodnight and went to bed.
…
Knock!
Knock! Knock!
Poundings on the door roused Klein from his dreams.
He peered out of the window to see the first glimmer of dawn. In a daze, he
flipped over and sat up.
“Who is it?”
Look at the time now! Why didn’t Melissa wake me up?
“It’s me. Dunn Smith,” a man with a deep voice outside the door replied.
Dunn Smith? Don’t know him… Klein got off his bed and shook his head
as he walked towards the door.
He opened the door to see the gray-eyed police inspector whom he had met
the day before standing in front of him.
Alarmed, Klein asked, “Is there something wrong?”
The policeman replied with a stern look, “We found a carriage driver. He
testified that you had gone to Mr. Welch’s place on the 27th—the day when
Mr. Welch and Ms. Naya died. Furthermore, Mr. Welch was the one who
paid for your transportation fees.”
Klein was startled. He did not feel a tinge of fear or guilt that one would
expect from having his lies exposed.
It was because he was not even lying. In fact, he was surprised by the
evidence provided by Dunn Smith.
On the 27th of June, the former Klein had indeed gone to Mr. Welch’s
place. On the night that he returned, he killed himself, the exact same way
as Welch and Naya did!
Klein gave a forced smile and said, “This is insufficient evidence. It does
not directly prove that I am associated with the death of Welch and Naya.
Honestly speaking, I’m also very curious about the whole incident. I want
to know what exactly happened to my two poor friends. But… But… I
really can’t remember. In fact I have almost completely forgotten what I had
done on the 27th. You may find it hard to believe, but I fully relied on the
diaries I had written to roughly make a guess that I had gone to Welch’s
place on the 27th.”
“You sure have great mental fortitude,” Dunn Smith said while nodding. He
showed not a trace of anger; nor was he smiling.
“You should be able to hear my sincerity,” Klein looked him straight in the
eye and said.
I’m telling the truth! Of course, only part of it!
Dunn Smith did not give an immediate response. He swept his glance
across the room before saying slowly, “Mr. Welch lost a revolver. I guess…
I should be able to find it here. Right? Mr. Klein?”
Indeed… Klein finally understood where the revolver had come from. A
thought flashed in his mind and he came to the final verdict in an instant.
He raised his hands halfway and retreated, leaving a path open. Then, he
signaled at the bunk bed with his chin.
“Behind the bed board.”
He did not specifically mention that it was the bottom deck, as no one
would normally hide things at the back of the bed board on an upper deck.
That would be too obvious for guests to notice at a glance.
Dunn Smith did not move forward. The corners of his mouth twitched as he
asked, “Nothing to add on?”
Without hesitation, Klein replied, “There is!”
“Yesterday, when I woke up in the middle of the night, I realized I was
laying on my desk with a revolver beside me. There was a bullet at the
corner of the room. It was as if I had committed suicide. But due to a lack
of experience of never having used a gun, or maybe I was too scared at the
final moment… Anyway, the bullet did not achieve the desired result, my
head is still in its place. I am still alive now.
“And since then, I have lost some memories, including what I saw and did
at Welch’s place on the 27th. I’m not lying. I really can’t remember.”
For the sake of being eliminated as a suspect. For the sake of getting rid of
all these strange events surrounding him, Klein explained almost everything
that had happened. Except, the transmigration and “gathering.”
Also, Klein was careful with his words, allowing every sentence to be
amenable. Such as, not revealing the fact that the bullet had hit his brains,
but only mentioning that it did not achieve the desired result, and that his
head was still in its place.
To others, these two statements might seem to convey the exact same ideas,
but in reality they were like chalk and cheese.
Dunn Smith listened quietly, then said, “This corresponds with what I had
surmised. It also corresponds with the hidden logic of similar incidents in
the past. Of course, I have no idea how you managed to survive.”
“I’m glad you believe in me. I don’t know how I survived either.” Klein
heaved a small sigh of relief.
“But—” Dunn threw out a conjunction. “There is no use in me believing
you. You are currently the prime suspect. You have to be confirmed by an
‘expert’ that you have indeed forgotten what you went through, or that you
indeed have nothing to do with the deaths of Mr. Welch and Miss Naya.”
He coughed, his expression becoming serious.
“Mr. Klein, I seek your cooperation on coming with me to the police station
for the investigation. This should take roughly two to three days if it is
confirmed that there are no issues with you.”
“The expert is here?” Klein asked blankly in return.
Didn’t they say it would take another two days?
“She came earlier than expected.” Dunn turned sideways, signaling for
Klein to leave.
“Allow me to leave a note,” Klein requested.
Benson was still away and Melissa had gone to school. He could only leave
a note to inform them that he was involved in an incident associated with
Welch so that they would not worry about him.
Dunn nodded, barely minding.
“Alright.”
Klein returned to the desk. As he searched for paper, he began thinking
about what was about to occur.
Honestly speaking, he did not wish to meet the ‘expert.’ After all, he had a
bigger secret.
In a place where there were seven major churches, under the premise that
Emperor Roselle, who was suspected to be a transmigrator predecessor, was
assassinated, a thing like ‘transmigration’ usually meant having to go to
court and enter arbitration!
But, without weapons, combat skills, or superpowers, he was no match for a
professional policeman. What’s more, a few of Dunn’s subordinates were
standing in the dark outside.
Once they draw their guns and shoot at me, I’d be finished!
“Ugh, I’ll take one step at a time.” Klein left the note, grabbed his keys, and
followed Dunn out the room.
Along the dark aisle, four policemen in black-and-white checkered
uniforms split into pairs and guarded them on both sides. They were very
alert.
Tap. Tap. Tap. Klein followed alongside Dunn as they went down the
wooden stairs which occasionally creaked in protest.
Outside the apartment, there was a four-wheeled carriage. On the side of the
carriage, there was the “two crossed swords and a crown” police emblem.
Their surroundings were crowded and bustling with noise as usual.
“Go on, up.” Dunn signaled for Klein to go first.
Klein was just about to step forward when an oyster seller suddenly
grabbed a customer and claimed that he was a thief.
Both parties wrestled and triggered a response from the horses, causing
great chaos.
An opportunity!
There wasn’t much time for Klein to think any further; he bent forward and
dashed towards the crowd.
Either shoving or dodging, he escaped frantically towards the other end of
the street.
Right now, for the sake of not “meeting” the expert, he could only proceed
by going to the pier outside the city, taking a boat down the Tussock River
and escaping to the capital, Backlund. The population was higher there,
making it easier to hide.
Of course, he could also get on a steam train, go eastward to the nearest
Enmatt Harbor and take the sea route to Pritz, then towards Backlund.
Not long after, Klein arrived at a street and made a turn onto Iron Cross
Street. There were several carriages that could be hired.
“To the pier outside the city.” Klein reached out his hand and hopped onto
one of the carriages.
He had thought through things clearly. Firstly, he had to mislead the police
that were coming for him. Once the carriage was a suitable distance away
from them, he would jump right off!
“Alrighty.” The carriage driver tugged at the reins.
Clop! Clop! Clop… The carriage left Iron Cross Street.
Just as Klein was about to jump off the carriage, he noticed that it had
turned into another road. It wasn’t leading out of the city!
“Where are you going?” Klein blurted in his momentary daze.
“To Welch’s place…” the carriage driver answered monotonously.
What!? Klein was at a loss for words. The carriage driver turned around,
exposing his cold gray eyes. It was Dunn Smith, the gray-eyed policeman!
“You!” Klein was flustered. Everything suddenly became a blur as though
the world spun around him when he instantly sat up.
Sat up? Klein looked around, confused. He noticed the crimson moon
outside the window and the room being covered in a crimson veil.
He reached out with his hand to feel his forehead. It was all moist and cold.
Cold sweat. His back felt exactly the same.
“It was a nightmare…” Klein heaved a sigh. “All is well… All is well…”
He found it weird. He was rather clear-minded in his dream, he was even
able to think calmly!
After calming down, Klein looked at his pocket watch. It was only two in
the morning. He got out of bed quietly and planned to head to the
washroom where he could wash his face and empty his burgeoning bladder.
He opened the door and walked along the dark corridor. Under the dim
moonlight, he walked lightly towards the washroom.
Suddenly, he noticed a silhouette outside the window at the end of the
corridor.
That silhouette was wearing a black windbreaker that was shorter than a
coat, but longer than a jacket.
That silhouette was partly camouflaged in the darkness, bathing in the
crimson moonlight.
That silhouette turned around slowly. His eyes deep, gray, and cold.
Dunn Smith!
