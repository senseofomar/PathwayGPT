Chapter 35

: Exchange of Information
Roselle Gustav’s secret diary?
Emperor Roselle?
Indeed, only such matters are worth the concern of a mighty figure like Mr.
Fool…Audrey was first taken aback before she realized that she found it
nothing surprising.
Rumor had it that Emperor Roselle had once seen the Blasphemy Slate. It
was said that the secret cards he created hid the twenty-two paths of the
divine. This was something every high-Sequence Beyonder would
definitely pay attention to!
“Diary? That’s a diary?” Alger frowned slightly as he keenly noticed this
tidbit.
The item which Roselle Gustav had left behind had been described by Mr.
Fool as a diary!
How did he know?
How did he determine it?
Could he know the way to decipher Roselle’s cryptic text?
Faced with The Hanged Man’s question and having obtained the desired
effect, Klein leaned back into his chair and interlocked his hands. He
answered in a relaxed manner, “Let us first view it as a diary for now.”
He did not deny or confirm it.
Audrey had heard the children of other nobles mention the matter. However,
she had never really learned much of it. With her curiosity piqued, she
asked, “It’s said that Emperor Roselle’s, well, diary was written in a cryptic
language or symbols he invented.”
“Yes,” answered Alger simply. “Some people believe that it is a unique set
of symbols from mysticism. Others believe that it is a hieroglyph. But up to
today, no one has found the correct way of deciphering it. At the very least,
that’s all I know.”
With that said, he turned his head at Klein in a bid to get some confirmation
or show his suspicions.
They are texts that have been passed down for generations, so are no longer
in their original state. According to your line of thought, how can it be
deciphered… Klein maintained his calm as he secretly gave a self-
deprecating laugh.
As for how to handle the symbols of mysticism, he instantly thought of a
ridiculous and funny scene.
Dressed in a black-pointed hat and long robe, an evil mage pulls up his
sleeve to reveal a symbol tattooed on his arm. It was said that this was a
symbol with mysterious power left behind by Emperor Roselle. They were
written in two blue, large simplified Chinese characters:
“Retarded Joker!”
The corners of Klein’s mouth curved up slowly as he found himself in a
good mood.
After hearing The Hanged Man’s description, Audrey said in a stumped
manner, “We can’t understand the symbols or the words… Then, how are
we to pass the information to you, Mr. Fool? Or are we to mail it
somewhere?”
This is quite an important question… I do not have the means to accept an
item secretly… Klein was in no hurry to answer. His repeatedly released his
thumbs from his interlocked hands before tapping them back again.
Soon, he thought of a solution.
Since I can create a divine palace and table according to my wishes in here,
would it be possible to project the content in the minds of others here?
I’ll give it a try…
At that moment, Audrey and Alger saw Mr. Fool slowly sit up amid the
thick grayish fog.
“Miss Justice, let us give it a try. Imagine a paragraph of text and give it the
emotions of writing it with urgency. Yes, pick up the fountain pen beside
you and write on the piece of paper.”
Before Klein finished his sentence, Audrey saw a piece of yellowish-brown
goatskin parchment and a dark red fountain pen in front of her.
She picked up the fountain pen both curiously and doubtfully. In
accordance with the instructions, she imagined a poem Emperor Roselle
once wrote:
“If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind 1 ?”
After scrutinizing the text, she picked up her fountain pen and imbued them
with the desire of projecting them out.
Klein sensed the emotions and using the fountain pen as a medium, he
guided her.
The moment Audrey landed her fountain pen, she saw a line appear on the
goatskin parchment.
“If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?”
“Goddess, how fascinating!” Audrey exclaimed in astonishment while
feeling rueful.
Following that, she looked at Klein with some fear.
“Mr. Fool, can you read what I’m thinking?”
“No, I’m only guiding you. I simplified the process of writing for you and
made it become an imprint. If you did not wish to express it, nothing would
appear.” Klein placated her with a low tone.
“Is that so… Then we can only memorize the symbols or the way the
cryptic text looks like. Then, we can present it directly as we wish?” Audrey
heaved a sigh of relief as she asked in enlightenment.
“Yes.” Klein answered.
“That’s not a bad method. Miss Justice, do not doubt your memory. After
becoming a Spectator, you will receive immense improvement in this
aspect.” Alger had watched the attempt from the side, fully coming to the
realization that The Fool was more powerful and mysterious than he
imagined.
As for his memory, he believed that the next advancement would improve it
sufficiently.
Regarding this, Audrey nodded in delight.
“You have delighted me with this reminder. Mr. Hanged Man, do you have
any other guidance on Spectators?”
With that said, she looked toward the Seat of Honor.
“Mr. Fool, I will work hard to complete your mission. I will do my best to
gather more of Emperor Roselle’s secret diary.”
“I mentioned before that I’m a person who likes a fair and equal exchange.
The advanced payment I gave is only equivalent to two pages of the diary
for each person. If there are more, I will give additional in return,” Klein
said calmly, like he was an adult who did not take advantage of children.
As for where the additional payment could come from, it was naturally
from the newly acquired Emperor Roselle diary pages. This formed a
virtuous cycle.
“You are truly a generous gentleman.” Alger fell silent for a few seconds
before bowing slightly with his hand by his chest.
After the bow, he turned to Justice and said, “Let me emphasize once more.
A Spectator will forever be a spectator.
“I know that many Spectators enjoy imagining themselves to be the
protagonist or some other character. As a result, they invest a lot of feelings
into it, to the point of crying, laughing, raging, and turning sorrowful
because of the drama. However, that is not what a Spectator should do.
“While faced with the various dramas of society and figures who knowingly
or unknowingly act the role of particular characters, you have to maintain
the attitude of being an absolute bystander. Only then can you calmly and
objectively observe them. You will discover their habits, their tics from
lying, or their scent of nervousness. From those minute clues, you can grasp
their true thoughts.
“Believe me, everyone is different because of their emotions. They will
secrete different ‘things’ and different smells. However, only a real
Spectator can sniff it out.
“Once you invest too many of your emotions, your observation will be
influenced. Your sensitivity towards the emotions of others will deviate.”
Audrey listened attentively as her eyes brightened gradually.
“It sounds, really, really interesting!”
Klein’s heart stirred when he heard that.
The Spectator potion’s requirement when summarized seemed to be “an
absolutely objective and neutral spectator.”
In a particular sense, it was equivalent to acting…
Acting?
Was this the ‘acting’ which Emperor Roselle was referring to?
Then, I will have to act as a Seer, and from there, digest the potion bit by
bit?
Just as Klein was immersing himself in thought, Alger finished explaining
the demands he knew of a Spectator. He sighed before saying, “It seems
like there’s nothing else?
“Perhaps we can have a casual chat. We can talk about things happening
around us. Perhaps it is something very normal to you, but in the ears of
others, it might be a very important clue.”
“Sure.” Klein snapped back and nodded slightly.
He was already planning to attempt to act as a Seer. After all, it did not
seem like there were any negative effects from doing so.
“Then, shall we begin with you, Mr. Hanged Man?” Audrey agreed in
excitement.
Alger thought for a moment before saying, “The infamous pirate who calls
himself Lieutenant General Deweyville has begun his voyage to explore the
eastern end of the Sonia Sea again.”
“Oh? The owner of the Black Tulip?” returned Audrey with a question after
some thought.
“Yes,” Alger replied with a nod.
I don’t even know who that is… Klein listened silently while he pondered
over the news he planned on sharing. It had to be something that did not
expose him while also allowing him to gain feedback.
Soon, he decided. He maintained his unfathomable image as The Fool and
caressed the side of the bronze table with his fingers.
“According to what I know, the Secret Order has lost an Antigonus family
notebook.”
This news was not only known by the Nighthawks from Tingen City. The
Secret Order as well as Beyonders with close ties with them similarly knew.
“An Antigonus family notebook?” Alger repeated before smiling with a
shake of his head. “I’m really curious as to what reaction the Church of the
Evernight Goddess will have if they learn of it.”
Why would he mention the Church of the Evernight Goddess? Klein acutely
sensed a problem, but it was not appropriate for him to ask.
That would shatter his image as the mysterious and profound Fool.
At that moment, Audrey asked out of curiosity, “Why are you curious?
What sort of special reaction would the Goddess’s church have?”
Alger smiled and said, “The Antigonus family was destroyed by the Church
of the Evernight Goddess.”
“I’m not really sure if it happened at the end of the Fourth Epoch or the
early stages of the present epoch.”
This… Klein’s pupils constricted as a chill suddenly swept through him.
From the looks of it, the value the Nighthawks have placed on this
Antigonus notebook far exceeds my imagination!
The reason why they nominated me as a Beyonder—having some
contribution and to prevent danger to me are likely negligible reasons—is
that they wish for me to raise my spiritual sensitivity to aid them in finding
the notebook.
This was not kept from me by Captain. He had mentioned it, but I just didn’t
pay much attention to it…
After hearing The Hanged Man’s explanation, Audrey said with deep
interest, “I never imagined that such a thing would happen…
“Alright, my turn. Let me think of what I have to share.”
She cocked her head and held her head up with her hand before chuckling.
“Yesterday, my etiquette teacher taught me how to faint, how to faint
elegantly without any faux paus. It’s a practical skill used at social events to
avoid awkward situations or nasty guys… Heh heh. I was just organizing
my thoughts. What I really wanted to say is that ever since the failure of the
battle on Balam’s eastern shore, the king, premier, and gentlemen are under
immense stress. They eagerly wish to change.”
