Chapter 113

: Request
Mr. Azik can tell that I’m a Beyonder? His ability is truly powerful… Klein
froze for a moment before he gave an honest reply.
“Yes.”
He thought for a while before adding, “Because of what happened to Welch
and Naya.”
“It’s as I thought…” Azik sighed. “There were two people with
extraordinary powers amongst the group of police that came to question me
and Cohen.”
It was probably Captain and Leonard. They were in charge of Welch’s
case… Klein nodded slightly, not interrupting Azik.
Azik raised his cane and said, “You should have entered their circle. I hope
that you can help me search for clues of my origin. You do not need to go
out of your way to do it, just note it down if you find any clues.”
Upon saying that, Azik wore a bitter smile.
“I don’t know any other person with extraordinary powers… You cannot
imagine what emotions a man without a past has. You are like a boat
floating in a vast ocean. The most terrifying thing is not facing a storm, but
not being able to find a harbor. The inability to navigate to shore. All you
can do is take on disaster after disaster, with no end in sight, never to feel
peace and safety.”
No Mr. Azik, I know how it feels, for I am in a similar position. Fortunately
for me, I have the memory fragments of the original Klein, as well as
Melissa and Benson…Klein answered silently before he asked, “Mr. Azik,
why didn’t you join a similar group when you possess such magical ability
and search for clues yourself?”
Azik looked into Klein’s eyes and let out a self-deprecating smile.
“Because I’m afraid. I’m afraid of death.”
He sighed and continued, “I have gotten used to life like this. I like my life.
I don’t have the courage to take that risk, so I can count on you.”
Klein didn’t say any more. He promised, “I’ll pay special attention if I
come across any clues.”
“Alright, we should return to the office. Let’s have lunch together with
Cohen when he’s done with work. Do you remember? The East Balam
Restaurant in the university is quite good. Heh, my treat.” Azik lifted his
cane and pointed to a direction.
My apologies, I really have no memories of that. How could the studying
original Klein have afforded the East Balam Restaurant? Even if Welch was
treating, he would still reject going to such an expensive place… Klein
pressed on his hat and returned to the third level of the grayish-stone
building which housed the history department with Azik.
A few steps later, Azik suddenly spoke.
“I’ll be on summer break after I finish settling all my work at the university.
You can visit me at my house or write to me.”
Klein nodded and said casually, “Mr. Azik, I thought that you would head to
Desi Bay for a vacation.”
“No, it is too hot in the south right now. I don’t like the so-called
sunbathing. Look at my skin color; it tans easily. I’d rather head to the
Winter County, to the north of the Feysac Empire to ski, sightsee, or hunt
seals.” Azik, who had a copper skin tone, smiled as he replied.
I would too… Klein, who had just joined the Nighthawks, revealed a look
of envy.
After lunch, Klein returned home and took a nap before beginning his
revision and study of charms and amulets. He hoped to grasp them quickly
to create objects that could at least be used in battle and help him.
When it was approaching three in the afternoon, Klein packed his stuff and
sealed the room with a wall of spirituality.
…
In the majestic divine hall above the gray fog sat a long, ancient mottled
table.
Klein sat at the seat of honor, his face enveloped by the thick fog. He
looked at the still-obscured Justice and The Hanged Man as they appeared
at their designated seats.
Hmm, Miss Justice’s emotions doesn’t seem too stable. Worry, unease, and
a little lost… Klein observed the only female member of the Tarot Club
with his Spirit Vision.
Words couldn’t describe Audrey Hall’s emotions. She was extremely
shocked by Susie’s sudden speech.
She had imagined a future with herself as a great detective or famous
psychologist bringing along her assistant Susie, but if that became the dog
detective Susie bringing along her assistant Miss Audrey, then it would be a
little, a little…
No, not a little, it would be straight up weird! It leaves me lost! Audrey
suddenly sat up straight. She wanted to request for Mr. Fool’s and The
Hanged Man’s help.
But she swallowed the words she was about to say.
Hmm, how should I ask this? What should I do if my pet is abnormal?
How should I interact with a pet that can speak, one that has decent
intelligence?
No, no, no, this is the Tarot Club, not an experience sharing on pets. I bet
that the good impression that The Hanged Man and Mr. Fool have of me
would shatter if I ask those questions!
Audrey’s mind whirled. Finally, she organized her words and said,
“Honorable Mr. Fool and Mr. Hanged Man, who has helped me all this
time, I have a question to ask. What can a pet with Beyonder powers do for
its owner? In other words, how useful is it?”
She had just said her piece when she noticed Mr. Fool and The Hanged Man
slip into silence. The atmosphere became a little weird.
Hey hey hey, say something, don’t look at me with those eyes, I did
nothing! Really, I was asking for a friend! Audrey wanted to burrow into a
hole out of shame.
She deeply regretted asking that question.
Considering that she had previously asked what would happen if an
ordinary animal consumed a Sequence potion, did she share the potion she
formulated with her pet? That seems like something only Miss Justice
would do… I feel a little pathetic being the boss of a ‘heretic cult’ with her
as a member… Klein lifted his right hand and propped it against his
forehead and pinched it twice without giving an answer.
The Hanged Man Alger Wilson was silent for nearly twenty seconds before
he replied in a strange tone, “That depends on what kind of Beyonder
powers the pet has. For example, if it’s a Spectator, then it can help you
observe or listen in on certain occasions. As you know, most humans are
wary of each other, but would never suspect that a pet would be
eavesdropping on them, even if the pet was sitting right by their feet.”
It makes sense! Father would avoid me when discussing important matters
with the nobles, cabinet members, and other ministers. They would often
lock the door to the room. But if Susie could hide long enough to be locked
in with them, then she wouldn’t be chased away… Also many ladies like to
interact within private social circles… Audrey had a sparkle in her eyes as
many thoughts welled in her mind.
Also, since Susie can speak now, she can tell me the content of the meetings
directly… Susie is great! I have to treat you well. I have to teach you proper
pronunciation and vocabulary…
Hmm, should I teach Susie the aristocratic pronunciation or a more normal
Backlund accent? Would other dogs pick up on where Susie comes from
when they interact? Wait, why am I considering this? Susie wouldn’t use
human language when interacting with other dogs…
Wait, Mr. Hanged Man, why did you use Spectator as an example?
C-could you have guessed what happened?
Audrey’s expression changed. She regained her posture and smiled.
“Mr. Fool, I found another page of Emperor Roselle’s diary.”
I got this from Fors Wall.
“Great, you have repaid what you owed,” Klein replied in a good mood.
“I am sorry, but there’s not much content on this page of the diary.” Audrey
was conjuring the content she remembered onto the piece of goatskin.
Klein raised his hand and made the goatskin parchment appear in his palm
before saying, “That doesn’t affect my promise. Furthermore, the parts of
the diary you handed me previously had two pages.”
The pages collected by Justice and The Hanged Man were not originals.
They were copied by researchers. Some would copy it on one page for
recording purposes, while others kept the original look of the diary for
convenience.
Klein looked down at the few lines of text on the page.
“December 20th. A new year approaches, but the feedback I received is
making me very confused and troubled.
“There is no crude oil in this world! There’s no crude oil to be found!”
