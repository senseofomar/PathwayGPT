Chapter 30

: Brand New Beginning
2, 4, and 6 Daffodil Street were terrace buildings with multifaceted hipped
roofs. Their exteriors were painted grayish blue, and three chimneys stood
erected.
The place obviously did not have lawns, gardens, or porches. The entrances
directly faced the street.
Tingen City Housing Improvement Company’s Scarter took out a bunch of
keys and while opening the door, introduced, “Our terrace houses do not
have foyers, so you enter directly into the living room. There’s an oriel
window facing Daffodil Street, so there’s pretty good lighting…”
Klein, Benson, and Melissa were greeted by a fabric sofa bathing in the
golden rays of the sun, and an area more spacious than their previous two-
bedroom apartment.
“This living room can be used as a guest hall. To its right is the dining room
and on the left is a fireplace that will keep you warm in winter.” Scarter
pointed around with great familiarity.
Klein looked around and confirmed that it was a crude, open-style concept.
The dining room and the living room were not separated by any partitions,
but they were also far from the oriel window, making those spots rather
dim.
There was a rectangular red wooden table surrounded by six hardwood
chairs with soft cushions. The fireplace on the left wall looked exactly like
the ones in foreign movies and TV series that Klein used to watch.
“Behind the dining area is the kitchen, but we do not provide any
appliances. Opposite to the living room is a small guest room and a
bathroom…” Scarter walked around and described the remaining layout of
the house.
The bathroom was separated into two parts. The outer area was where one
would wash their face and brush their teeth, while the inner area was the
toilet. There was an accordion door that separated them. The guest room
was described to be small, but it was as big as the room that Melissa
currently stayed in. She was stunned at the sight.
After looking around the first floor, Scarter brought the three siblings to the
stairway next to the bathroom.
“Down below is the underground cellar. It is quite stuffy downstairs, so you
must remember to let some fresh air in first before entering.”
Benson nodded casually and followed Scarter to the second floor.
“On my left, there’s a bathroom. On the same side, there are an additional
two bedrooms. It’s the same layout on my right, but the washroom on this
side is next to the balcony.”
As he spoke, Scarter opened the bathroom door and stood sideways so that
he would not obstruct Klein, Benson, and Melissa from looking in.
The bathroom had an extra bathtub. Like the other bathroom, there was an
accordion door next to the toilet. Although it was a little dusty, it wasn’t
dirty, smelly, or cramped.
Melissa looked in a daze until Scarter walked to the bedroom next to it.
Only then did she stop looking and follow the rest slowly.
She took another few steps before looking back.
Klein, who was experienced in life, was delighted and excited as well. Even
though their landlord often supervised their cleaning up of the bathroom, it
still was not clean enough. It was often nauseating, let alone the fact that
they would easily encounter a line when they needed to relieve their
urgencies.
The other bathroom was similar. One of the four bedrooms was slightly
bigger and was furnished with a bookcase. The rest were about the same
size as each other and had a bed, table, and wardrobe.
“The balcony is very tiny, so you won’t be able to dry too many clothes in
the sun at a time.” Scarter stood at the end of the corridor and pointed to a
spot with a door and lock. “There is a complete underground drainage, gas
piping, meter, and other facilities. It is very suitable for you gentlemen and
a lady like yourselves. It only requires thirteen soli of rent and five pence
for use of the furniture weekly. In addition, there is a deposit that amounts
to four weeks of rent.”
Without waiting for Benson to say a word, Klein looked around and asked
curiously, “Roughly how much would it cost to buy the house?”
As a transmigrator from the Foodaholic Empire, the desire to buy property
still existed within him.
Upon hearing that question, Benson and Melissa were shocked. They
looked at Klein as though they were seeing a monster. Scarter replied
calmly and firmly, “Buy? No, we do not sell property. We only provide
rental properties.”
“I’m just trying to have a general sense of the prices.” Klein explained
awkwardly.
Scarter hesitated for a few seconds before saying, “Last month, the owner
of 11 Daffodil Street sold a limited-period land deed with a similar property
sitting atop the land. 300 pounds for fifteen years. It is much cheaper than
renting directly but not everyone can fork out such a large sum of money. If
one would like to buy it over completely, the owner’s posted price 850
pounds.”
850 pounds? Klein quickly made the mental calculations.
My weekly pay is three pounds, Benson eans one pound and ten soli… Rent
is thirteen soli and if we eat well every day, we would spend nearly two
pounds a week. On top of that, there are expenses such as clothes,
transportation, social expenditures, so on and so forth. We can only save
less than twenty soli a week. One year adds up to about 35 pounds. 850
pounds would require more than twenty years. Even if it we bought the land
for a limited period of time for 300 pounds, it would take us at least eight or
nine years… That doesn’t include getting married, living independently,
raising children, traveling, and so on…
In a world without individual housing loans, most people are likely to opt
for rental…
Realizing this, he stepped back and stole a glance at Benson. He beckoned
him to talk to Scarter about the rent.
As for Melissa’s intentions, they were obvious from her bright eyes!
At that moment, Klein suddenly thought of letting Benson loose.
Benson tapped his plain cane and looked around before he said, “We should
take a look at other houses. The dining area’s lighting isn’t good, and the
balcony is very small. Look, only that bedroom has a fireplace, and the
furniture is too old. If we move in, we have to at least change half of
these…”
He pointed out faults in a hurried tone, spending ten minutes to persuade
Scarter to lower the rent to twelve soli and the furniture usage fee to three
pence, while rounding up the deposit to two pounds.
Without further ado, the siblings returned with Scarter to the Tingen City
Housing Improvement Company and signed two copies of the contract.
They then headed over to the Notary Office of Tingen City to notarize the
contract.
After paying the deposit and first week’s rent, Klein and Benson’s
remaining money added up to nine pounds, two soli, and eight pence.
Standing before the door of 2 Daffodil Street, they each held a bunch of
copper keys. They were momentarily unable to look away; their emotions
churning within them.
“It feels like a dream…” After a while, Melissa lifted her head to look at the
future “Moretti Residence,” and she spoke with a low yet unsteady voice.
Benson let out a breath and smiled.
“Then don’t wake up.”
Klein wasn’t as emotional as they were. He nodded and said, “We need to
change the locks of the main door and balcony door as soon as possible.”
“There’s no hurry. The reputation of Tingen City Housing Improvement
Company is very good. The rest of the money is for your formal suit.
However, before that, we need to pay Mr. Franky a visit.” Benson pointed
in the direction of the apartment.
…
The siblings made do with rye bread at home before heading for a terrace
apartment on Iron Cross Street. When they knocked on their landlord’s
door, Mr. Franky declared imposingly while his short frame perched on a
sofa, “You know my rules. No one is allowed to be behind their rent!”
Benson leaned forward and smiled.
“Mr. Franky, we are here to give up our lease.”
That straightforward? Would negotiating this way work? Standing beside
Benson, Klein was shocked when he heard him.
On the way here, Benson had said that his bottomline was a compensation
of twelve soli.
“Give up your lease? No! We have a contract, and there’s still half a year
left!” Franky glared at Benson as he flailed his arms.
Benson looked at him seriously and waited for a moment before saying
calmly, “Mr. Franky, you should understand that you could have made
much more money.”
“Make much more?” Franky asked with interest, touching his skinny face.
Benson sat up straight and explained with a smile, “The two-bedroom unit
was rented to the three of us for five soli and six pence. But if you were to
rent it to a family of five or six people, with two or three of them working
and getting paid, I think they would be willing to pay more to stay there
instead of staying at Lower Street where its ridden with crime. I think five
soli ten pence or six soli would be a reasonable price.”
Franky’s eyes brightened up and his throat moved as Benson continued to
say, “Besides, you are certainly aware that rental prices have been
increasing in recent years. The longer we stay, the greater a loss you incur.”
“But… I need time to look for a new tenant.” Mr. Franky, who had inherited
the apartment building, obviously liked the idea.
“I believe you can find one very quickly since you have the ability and
resources to do so. Maybe two days, maybe three days… We will pay for
the losses you incur during this time. How about the deposit of three soli
that we have paid? It is very reasonable!” Benson immediately decided for
Franky.
Franky nodded in satisfaction.
“Benson, you are such a conscientious and honest young man. Alright then,
let’s sign the termination of contract.”
Klein was dumbfounded watching this happen. He completely understood
how easy it was to ‘convince’ Mr. Franky.
That’s way too easy…
With the problem of the previous contract resolved, the three siblings first
helped Klein buy his formal wear and then got busy with moving house.
They didn’t have anything heavy or bulky as bulkier items belonged to the
landlord. Thus, Benson and Melissa rejected Klein’s idea of hiring a
carriage, and instead carried their things themselves. They went back and
forth between Daffodil Street and Iron Cross Street.
The hot sun outside the window set in the west, and golden rays shone
through the oriel window, scattering across the desk’s surface. Klein looked
at the rack that had books and notebooks arranged neatly before putting an
ink bottle and a fountain pen on the table which he had wiped cleaned
earlier.
It’s finally over… He let out a breath of relief and heard his stomach growl.
He loosened his rolled up sleeves as he walked towards the door.
He had a bed that belonged to him. The bedsheet and blanket were white,
old but clean.
Klein twisted the doorknob and walked out of his bedroom. Just as he was
preparing to say something, he saw both doors on the opposite side open
simultaneously as Benson and Melissa came into his view.
Looking at the dust and dirt marks on their faces, Klein and Benson
suddenly burst out into laughter, sounding abnormally cheerful.
Melissa bit her lips lightly but the laughter was contagious. She eventually
let out a soft laugh.
…
The next morning.
Klein stood before a full-length mirror with no cracks, seriously smoothing
out his collar and sleeves of his shirt.
The outfit included a white shirt, black tuxedo, silk top hat, black vest, a set
of trousers, boots, and a bow tie. He felt the pinch of paying eight pounds in
total.
However, the effect was great. Klein felt that his reflection in the mirror
exhibited greater scholarly qualities and made him look more handsome.
Click!
He closed his pocket watch and put it into his inner pocket. He then took his
cane and hid his revolver. He took the tracked public carriage and arrived at
Zouteland Street.
The moment he entered the Blackthorn Security Company, he realized that
he was so used to his previous lifestyle that he had forgotten to give Melissa
extra money but allowed her to walk to school instead.
Shaking his head, he took note of it before stepping into Blackthorn
Security Company. He saw the brown-haired girl, Rozanne, making coffee.
A rich aroma permeated throughout the office.
“Good morning, Klein. The weather is great today,” Rozanne greeted him
with a smile. “To be frank, I have always been curious. In such weather,
don’t you men feel hot wearing those formal suits? I know for a fact that
Tingen’s summer isn’t as hot as the South’s, but it is still summer.”
“It’s the price of style,” Klein replied humorously. “Good morning, Miss
Rozanne. Where’s the Captain?”
“Same old place.” Rozanne pointed inside.
Klein nodded. He went through the partition and knocked on Dunn Smith’s
office door.
“Come in.” Dunn’s voice was deep and gentle as usual.
When he saw Klein, who looked quite different in a set of nice formal wear,
he nodded and his gray eyes smiled.
“Have you decided?” he asked.
Klein took a deep breath and answered seriously, “Yes, I have made a
decision.”
Dunn slowly sat up straight. His expression became solemn but the deep
recesses of his gray eyes remained the same.
“Tell me your answer.”
Klein replied without hesitation, “Seer!”
