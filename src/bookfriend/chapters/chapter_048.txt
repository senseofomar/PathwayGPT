Chapter 48

: Hanass Vincent
In the Divination Club situated at the second floor of 13 Howes Street,
North Borough of Tingen City.
Klein saw the beautiful lady that attended to visitors once again.
She was still having her brownish-yellow long hair coiled, making her look
mature and elegant. It was hard to tell her age.
“Hello, Mr. Glacis isn’t here today. Would you like to change fortune-tellers
today?” said the beautiful lady with a smile.
Upon hearing that, Klein, who had just taken off his silk hat and put it back
on, was immediately surprised.
“You still remember me?”
That was already five days ago!
The woman puckered her lips into a smile.
“You are the first customer that sought Mr. Glacis’s services. You are also
the only one to this very day. It’s hard for me not to have a deep impression
of you.”
Was this the image of him being penny-wise, pound-foolish? Klein
lampooned himself as he deliberated a question.
“When was the last time Mr. Glacis came to the club?”
The lady shot a glance at him and answered seemingly in recollection, “To
be honest, we are unable to grasp when our members will come and go.
They have their free will and personal matters to tend to. Well, I do believe
that Mr. Glacis hasn’t come to the club since he told your fortune that day.”
I wish him the best of luck. May the Goddess bless him… Klein prayed and
did not ask further. Instead, he asked with a smile, “I’m not here for
divination services this time. I plan to join the club.”
“Really? That’s our pleasure.” The lady expressed a timely look of surprise
delight. “For the first year as a member, the membership fee is five pounds.
It will be one pound a year thereafter. I believe there’s no need for me to
describe in the details again?”
Klein took out a five-pound note he recently received as he watched Henry
Augustus I’s portrait depart him.
After seriously checking the anti-counterfeit watermark, the woman stored
away the note seriously and handed a form to Klein.
“Please feel in your detailed information. Let me prepare the receipt for
you.”
There’s a receipt? You should bill it to Blackthorn Security Company…
Klein was amused by his own thoughts as he picked up a fountain pen on
the desk. With the blackish-blue ink, he filled in his name, age, address, and
company information.
However, he had deliberately left his date-of-birth empty. To a Seer, that
provided profound mysteries about his body through his Life Path Number.
After receiving the receipt and finishing his registration as a member, the
lady extended her right hand.
“Congratulations on joining Tingen City’s Divination Club. I’m Angelica
Barrehart, your hardworking server. This is your member cufflinks. There
are special inscriptions on them which will identify you as a member.”
“Hello, Madam Angelica.” Klein shook her hand and took the dark gold
cufflinks.
He realized that the special inscription was written with the root word for
‘fortune-teller’ in Hermes.
Angelica retracted her left hand and thought for a few seconds.
“Might I ask what divination arts you are most familiar with? Or would you
prefer to learn some divination methods from the club? We will consider
inviting famous fortune-tellers of the corresponding domain to give classes.
We will also introduce you members with similar expertise so that you can
have a good time interacting with them.”
“I know a bit of every divination art. There’s no need to give me any special
considerations.” Klein replied with some embellishments. In addition, he
inquired, “Can I begin telling the fortunes of others? I’m not a total rookie.”
He was here to act as a Seer and not learn the divination methods ordinary
people could learn.
Angelica maintained a polite smile as she said, “You can tell the fortunes of
people anytime in the club. However, before we confirm your skills, we will
not promote you when our customers ask. How much do you plan on
charging for your fortune-telling?”
“Two pence.” Klein decided to gain at advantage with price while he was
still unknown.
“We will go by the standard of taking an eighth, so we will be taking a
quarterpence for fees…” Angelica repeated the various rules first before
writing Klein’s information into the fortune-teller album which customers
could choose from.
After all of this was done, she pointed at the meeting room at the far end of
the corridor with a smile.
“Mr. Hanass Vincent is currently explaining astrolabe divination. You can
find a quiet spot to listen in. You can also raise your questions if there are
any queries.”
“Alright.” Klein walked toward the meeting room with his interest piqued.
He wanted to know the differences between what Hanass Vincent and Old
Neil said.
At that moment, Angelica chased up and whispered, “Mr. Moretti, would
you want coffee or tea? We provide Sibe black tea, Southville coffee, and
Desi coffee.”
Klein, who had been reading the papers regularly, knew that these coffees
and black tea were considered as one of the inferior varieties, but he also
knew that they were definitely of better quality than the ones he had at
home. After some thought, he said, “A cup of Southville coffee. Three
teaspoons of sugar without milk please.”
Loen Kingdom’s Southville was famous for its beer and red wine; many
important figures were fond of them. However, their coffee was relatively
unknown.
“Alright, I’ll send it to you in a bit.” Angelica pointed towards the meeting
room.
Klein slowly walked to the half-closed door and heard a voice in a thick
Awwa accent explaining, “Astrolabe divination is a relatively more
complex one among the divination arts…”
But that’s only for ordinary people… Klein silently tagged on a sentence for
the speaker. He saw about five tables placed in a circle inside the meeting
room. It surrounded a middle-aged man in a black classic robe, Hanass
Vincent.
The gentleman had obvious dark circles. His brown hair was thick and hard.
Each strand stood firmly like a porcupine’s spikes.
Apart from that, there was nothing unique about him.
Upon seeing Klein enter, Hanass Vincent nodded gently without stopping
his class. He only slowed down his speech.
Klein had one hand in his pocket while the other held his cane. He found a
seat to the sides and sat down, leaning back comfortably in the process. He
scanned the circle of six members. There were four men and two women.
Some of them were attentively taking notes, whispering, or returning Klein
a rueful smile.
After placing his cane down, Klein adjusted his halved top hat and tapped
his glabella twice in the process.
He cast his gaze at Hanass and saw the different colors, brightness, and
thickness of his aura.
“Dark red. He’s a little worried… Actually, every other part of his body is
healthy except that part. I wonder what’s wrong…” Klein listened to the
class while muttering to himself.
At that moment, he clasped his right hand and covered his mouth to prevent
his laughter from sounding. He suddenly felt like he was a quack.
He was rather pleased with his Spirit Vision ability. Although he could only
make a general judgment and not the details, it was enough to gain him
many useful information.
After surveying his surroundings, he tapped his glabella twice again as
though he was pondering over what Hanass had just said.
Astrolabe divination was one of the astromancy divination methods.
However, ordinary people could also attempt to interpret things. For
instance, the most basic birth horoscope was to determine the inquirer’s fate
by determining the positions of the sun, moon, blue and red stars at their
birth, the corresponding spots in the sky, matching the representative
symbols to the astrolabe, and the corresponding situations of the different
constellations.
This required the fortune-teller to be able to calculate the states of the
planets and constellations which was rather complicated. Of course, there
were publications that aided people to look up the values. Some even
simplified it by making a vague read with just the constellations.
Klein listened silently without interjecting or asking any questions. From
time to time, he would caress the hanging topaz at his sleeve or take a sip of
the Southville coffee which Angelica had brought in.
After some time, Hanass rubbed his glabella and said, “Perhaps you will
need to attempt at creating your own astrolabe. Ask me if you have any
questions. I will be in Moonstone.”
After he left, a young man in a white shirt and black vest got up with a
smile and walked to Klein’s side.
“Nice to meet you. I’m Edward Steve.”
“My pleasure. I’m Klein Moretti.” Klein stood up and returned the bow.
“Astrolabes are too complicated. Every time I hear about it, I can’t help but
doze off,” said Edward self-deprecatingly.
Klein grinned and said, “That’s because Mr. Vincent can’t help but pass the
knowledge he grasps to us. It’s like giving us an Intis feast. It’s just
indigestible.”
“I’d be able to finish the Intis feast. They usually use a huge plate to serve
tiny bits of food.” Edward chuckled and sat up. He asked out of curiosity,
“Are you new? I’ve not seen you in the two years I was here.”
“I just joined the club today,” answered Klein frankly.
“What are you good at? I’m best at tarot and poker divination,” Edward
casually asked.
“I know a little of everything, but just a little.” Klein gave a description he
used to give himself.
He was not being modest since there was just too much mysterious
knowledge he had not grasped in the domain of divination.
Just as the other members were thinking of talking about horoscope
divination, Angelica walked into the meeting room.
“Mr. Steve, someone wants you to tell their fortunes.”
“Alright.” Edward stood up with a smile.
“I can tell you are an excellent fortune-teller,” said Klein as he looked at
him.
“No, it’s because my price is most suitable,” said Edward with a soft
chortle. “When ordinary people come to have their fortunes told, they will
absolutely not choose the most expensive ones. And unless they had their
heads kicked by asses, they would definitely not be choosing the cheapest
few. It’s easiest to gain opportunities if you are in the middle.”
I’m one of those that had their heads kicked by asses… When he saw
Edward leave, Klein suddenly shook his head with a wry smile.
It seems the price I set is problematic…
He stood up, picked up his cane, and left the meeting room. He found
Angelica again.
“I wish to change the prices of my divination. Uh, set it to eight pence.”
Angelica took a deep look at him and said, “We will satisfy your request,
but we will also tell customers that you only recently joined the club.”
“No problem.” Klein did not mind as he nodded.
At times, mystery was also an important element for a Seer to attract
customers.
After changing his details, Klein returned to the meeting room.
At that moment, he saw Hanass Vincent walk out of Moonstone. He held a
silver-coated mirror.
This well-known fortune-teller said to the five members in the meeting
room, “I recently learned a new divination art. Magic mirror divination.
Does anyone want to learn?”
Magic mirror divination? That’s not safe… Klein paused outside the
meeting room and frowned.
