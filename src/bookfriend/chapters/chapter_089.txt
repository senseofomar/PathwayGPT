Chapter 89

: A Simple Mission
Klein nodded and said, “Alright, but I still don’t know what my mission is.”
“Nothing dangerous. I haven’t seen any signs of danger at the very least,”
Dunn emphasized. “This is a case which was referred to us by Golden
Indus’s police department. The famous philanthropist Sir Deweyville has
been experiencing unusual harassment over the past month. Be it his
bodyguards, the security guards he has employed, or the police, none of
them have been able to find the culprit. Inspector Tolle, who is in charge of
this case, suspects that it involves Beyonder powers and, thus, handed the
case over to us.”
I saw Sir Deweyville at the library the other day and noticed that he was
feeling down and lethargic. So it was a result of being harassed… Klein
knitted his brows and asked, “What kind of harassment is it?”
There hasn’t been any physical harm inflicted yet; thus, the harassment
wouldn’t be considered dangerous.
“Sir Deweyville hears moans and cries every night, no matter where he is,
be it Tingen or not. This has affected his sleep quality negatively.” Dunn
flipped the notes in his hands. “He has seen a psychiatrist and has asked his
butlers and servants to confirm that it was not an illusion. Having confirmed
that it isn’t a hallucination, thus, it is suspected that someone is harassing
him.”
Closing the file, Dunn looked up at Klein.
“Change into your probationary inspector uniform in the break room, then
meet Inspector Tolle who is in charge of this case at the Shooting Club.
He’ll provide you with more details.”
“Probationary inspector uniform?” Klein asked instinctively.
Dunn rubbed his forehead and smiled.
“Half of our salary comes from the police department, and the title of
probationary inspector doesn’t merely belong in the records. When you met
Leonard and I for the first time, we were also wearing uniforms. This is a
perk held by fully official members. Yes, the ‘Perks’ as Emperor Roselle
would call it.”
Unfortunately, I can’t wear it as a casual outfit. Otherwise, I’d be able to
have another spare outfit when my clothes are being washed… Klein picked
up his cane and bade farewell before leaving the captain’s office.
He headed toward the break room and saw a black and white checkered
uniform, complete with leather boots, placed on the table. The uniform’s
peak cap was embroidered with the logo of the police department—two
crossed swords and a crown. Located on the shoulder was a black and white
epaulet with a shimmering silver star.
“This is a probationary inspector uniform?” Klein glanced at the uniform
and noticed a string of numbers under the silver stars: 06-254.
He had some understanding of the police rank structure in the Loen
Kingdom. He knew that those at the top were the minister and the chief
secretary of the police force. Under them were the respective
commissioners, deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners of the
various police departments. Those in the middle were superintendents and
inspectors, while those at the very bottom were the sergeants and
constables.
After closing the door, Klein took off his suit and hat before changing into
the uniform.
He hung his suit up and left the room. He made his way into the clerk’s
office and looked at himself using the full-body mirror that Rozanne
brought to him.
The young man in the mirror had black hair with gentle brown eyes. The
uniform on his body accentuated him with a heroic spirit.
“Not bad.” Klein praised himself narcissistically. He left his cane in the
office and left the Blackthorn Security Company.
Inside his pockets were a full set of equipment, ranging from weapons to
his police badge.
…
At the hall of the Shooting Club.
Klein met Inspector Tolle immediately since he was the only one in a police
uniform.
Of course, there’s me too… Klein thought.
There were two silver stars on the epaulets of Inspector Tolle’s uniform. His
clothes were propped up by his stomach and he had a thick blond mustache.
His frame was tall but not imposing. Perhaps, it was imposing in the past.
“Moretti? Klein Moretti?” Inspector Tolle noticed Klein and welcomed him
with a smile.
“Hello, Inspector Tolle, I believe that you have the right person,” Klein
replied amicably, then following his memories, he raised his right arm, kept
his fingers straight and tight before saluting.
Tolle chuckled.
“I can tell that you’ll be a young man who’s easy to get along with. That’s
good. Shall we head to Sir Deweyville’s place now?”
Even though he was a higher rank than Klein, the tone in his query was
obviously friendly.
“No problem.” Klein thought for a moment before he said, “You can fill me
in on the details of the case on the carriage.”
“Sure.” Tolle stroked his thick blond beard and guided Klein out of the
Shooting Club. They boarded a carriage which was stopped on the other
side of the road.
There was the “two crossed swords and a crown” police emblem on the
carriage, and it came with a personal carriage driver.
“Sir Deweyville is a believer of the Goddess, so we referred the case to
you,” Tolle said quickly as he sat down.
“I know. The fine knight is a common figure on the covers of newspapers
and magazines.” Klein flashed a friendly smile.
Tolle picked up the document docket beside him and removed the seal
before taking out the materials inside. As he flipped through them, he
explained, “Regardless, even if you are aware of it, I need to provide you
with the detailed briefing.
“Sir Deweyville is one of the richest tycoons of Tingen City. He built his
career beginning with a lead and porcelain factory. It has now expanded to
steel, coal, shipping, banking, and bonds. He is also a great philanthropist
that has been praised by the king, having set up the Deweyville Charity
Foundation, the Deweyville Trust, and the Deweyville Library… He was
also knighted five years ago… If he were willing to run for mayor, I don’t
think anyone in Tingen City could contest with him.
“But Backlund is his goal; he wants to become a member of parliament. We
once suspected that the harassment might be related to this, but we have no
clues to this date.”
Klein nodded slightly and said, “We can’t rule out that possibility, but
there’s nothing to confirm that suspicion as of now.”
Tolle didn’t dwell on this point. He continued, “From the sixth of last
month, Sir Deweyville has heard painful skin-numbing moans every night
when he sleeps, akin to a patient’s fight for his life. He has checked the
surrounding rooms multiple times, but he hasn’t found anything unusual.
His butler and servants have also confirmed that they heard such sounds,
but it is simply softer for them.
“In the beginning, Sir Deweyville believed that this matter would pass
quickly and didn’t pay too much attention to it. But the moans became more
and more frequent, to the point of occasionally happening during the day.
There was even the addition of heart-wrenching cries.”
“This has made Sir Deweyville lose sleep, time and time again he had no
choice but to leave Tingen to his villa in the villages. But it was to no avail.
The moans and cries persisted. Similarly, the phenomenon persisted even in
Backlund, just that it wasn’t as serious.
“He employed security guards to check his surroundings, but they didn’t
find any clues. Our preliminary investigations also came up with nothing.
“Sir Deweyville, who has been tortured for more than a month, is on the
brink of collapse. He visited psychiatrists time and time again but was
unable to have his problems resolved. He told us that if this problem was
not solved within a month, he would leave Tingen and head to Backlund.
He believes that there would be people who can help him there.”
After listening to Tolle’s explanation, Klein quickly analyzed and came up
with a few possibilities.
He offended a Beyonder and is suffering from a curse?
No, if he was suffering from a curse, the butlers and servants in his house
wouldn’t hear the same things…
There’s a Beyonder with unknown motives hidden among his servants and
bodyguards?
But the problem stems from the point that there has been no requests made
of Sir Deweyville over the past month…
Perhaps Sir Deweyville accidentally came into contact with some vengeful
evil spirit?
That possibility cannot be ruled out…
The carriage entered the Golden Indus borough while Klein was still deep
in thought. It stopped at the door of Sir Deweyville’s house.
A steel fence surrounded a lush garden. There were two statues by the side
of the hollowed metal gates, a magnificent fountain that showered a marble
sculpture with water, an expansive two-story building, as well as a path
wide enough to fit three carriages.
“Even the knight’s house is only two stories high… The newspaper reported
that Backlund is experimenting with building ten-story apartments…” Klein
got off the carriage and saw a sergeant with three chevron stripes walking
over briskly.
He looked at Klein and saluted.
“Good morning, Sir!”
“Good morning.” Klein nodded with a smile.
Tolle smiled.
“This is Sergeant Gate, you can tell him if you need anything.
“This is Probationary inspector Moretti, a history and psychological expert
from the police department,” Tolle introduced Klein to Gate.
…I don’t deserve such a title… Klein felt a little embarrassed.
After the greetings, Gate pointed to the two-story building behind the
fountain and said, “Sir Deweyville is waiting for us.”
“Alright.” Klein caressed the revolver at his waist.
That was his best bet against an enemy.
Since he was in police uniform, he could put his revolver in a holster at his
hip, making it easier to draw it.
As they spoke, the trio made their way down the path, around the fountain,
and arrived outside the door.
By then, the door was already opened by a servant who was waiting politely
at the side.
As Klein pretended to adjust his hat, he tapped twice on his glabella to
activate his Spirit Vision before entering the house.
The square-faced Sir Deweyville was massaging his forehead in the hall.
He was clearly in low spirits. His blond hair and blue eyes were either dry
or dull as though he had aged considerably by at least five years.
“Good morning, Sir Deweyville.” Klein, Tolle, and Gate bowed at the same
time.
Sir Deweyville stood up and forced out a smile.
“Good morning, Officers. I hope that you can resolve what has been
causing me distress.”
At that moment, Klein squinted and slightly knitted his brows.
Other than his low spirits, Klein couldn’t find any other problems with Sir
Deweyville.
That’s odd… He thought for a moment before he said, “Sir, in which room
did you first hear the moans?”
“My bedroom.” Sir Deweyville shook his head.
“Can we take a look?” inquired Klein.
“Haven’t you checked it many times?” the middle-aged butler interrupted
from the side.
It was clear that he didn’t notice that Klein was the partner of the kind-
hearted soul that had “not pocketed the money that he picked up.”
Klein smiled, composed.
“Those were my colleagues, not me.”
“Sir, this is an expert sent by the police agency,” Tolle said, taking the
opportunity to introduce him.
Deweyville looked at the young expert and said, “Alright, Cullen, take him
to my room.”
“Sir, I hope that you will come with us,” Klein said seriously.
Deweyville hesitated for a few seconds before saying, “If that can solve the
problem…”
He grabbed his cane as he spoke. He made his way feebly toward the
staircase with the butler Cullen and several guards beside him, ready to
support him if needed.
Klein surveyed the surroundings as he followed behind them silently.
One step, two steps, three steps… They arrived at the second story and
entered the master bedroom.
Klein didn’t have the time to survey the surroundings when the hair on his
body stood on their ends.
This was feedback from his spiritual perception!
