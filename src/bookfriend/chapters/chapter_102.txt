Chapter 102

: Cloth Merchant
The more Klein thought about it, the more likely it seemed. Otherwise, who
would have borrowed those random journal issues for no reason?
Yes, research regarding the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range is
quite an unpopular field. Other than the corresponding lecturers and
associate professors, the common hobbyist would’ve never heard of it. Even
the original Klein, who was a history graduate, only knew about it from the
Antigonus family’s notebook… Although Tingen is a city of universities,
there wouldn’t be that many people who would interested in the topic. And
even if there is anyone interested, most of them would remain within the
university’s compounds. There would be no need to borrow the book from
the Deweyville Library.
The most important point is that the book happened to be borrowed only
recently…
By analyzing it this way, there really is a problem. I wasn’t sharp enough
and failed to realize it… Sigh, it looks like I have no talent at being a
detective or acting like Sherlock Holmes…
While these thoughts raced through his mind, the boss of Evil Dragon Bar,
Swain asked in puzzlement, “Is there a problem?”
Since there were customers and bartenders around, he could only ask
indirectly.
“Nothing at all. I’m just wondering how I can investigate this gentleman.
As you know, Hanass Vincent died at his home.” Klein had long prepared
his excuse.
He didn’t want to make the Mandated Punishers become interested in the
ancient relics from the main peak of the Hornacis mountain range.
“Vincent was one of the rather famous fortune-tellers in Tingen City. He
often came here.” Swain had indeed given a perfunctory answer, but as he
recalled, he said, “Now that I think about it, the gentleman in the portrait
did come together with Vincent at the very beginning…”
“That is exactly what I wanted to know. Do you remember his name?”
Klein pressed immediately.
Swain shook his head and chuckled.
“I won’t ask for my customers’ names or identities unless I knew them to
begin with, like Old Neil.”
“Alright then.” Klein deliberately revealed a saddened look.
To him, it didn’t matter if Swain knew, because he could check the
Deweyville Library.
To borrow books from a privately-funded library, he had to leave personal
information, and his identification must have had sufficient credibility!
After all, Klein had relied on an introduction letter from a Senior Associate
Professor before he obtained a library card.
Even if the gentleman had forged his information, it is very likely that he
left some clues which can be helpful to my divination… Klein watched
Swain as he returned to the bar counter before entering the billiard room in
deep thought.
He wasn’t in a hurry to head to the Deweyville Library for his
investigations. He planned on completing his purchases first. After all, it
was unknown if he would encounter danger and be required to use
ritualistic magic for subsequent developments.
After passing through a few rooms, Klein arrived at the underground
market. There were a few stalls and customers, a clear indication that it
wasn’t peak hour yet.
Just as he took a step forward, he suddenly saw the monster, Ademisaul,
who could smell the scent of death, standing in a corner.
The young man was pale, and his eyes gave off a hint of terror and
madness. He had also noticed Klein as he looked over.
As they made eye contact, Ademisaul suddenly extended his hands to cover
his face. He moved toward the corner of the wall in a panicked state.
Soon, he moved to a side door beside him and staggered as he ran out.
Is that necessary? I just nearly blinded you the last time… But I didn’t do
anything… Seriously, it’s as if I’m the devil. Klein’s facial expression was
somewhat stiff.
He shook his head and smiled. He stopped thinking about the monster and
came to a stall. He started shopping with a goal in mind.
After about half an hour, Klein spent a few pounds which was most of his
secret stash of money.
He counted the three pounds and seventeen soli he had left, and he felt his
heart ache. However, he touched the small metal bottle in the inner pocket
of his black windbreaker.
“This is the floral essence, Amantha, which Madam Daly used previously.
“This is powder mixed with drago tree bark and leaves.
“Essential oil which is extracted from slumber flowers.
“Dried chamomile petals.
“This is Holy Night Powder which I previously produced myself.”
…
Klein recalled the items stored in every tiny pocket of his and repeated
them. He did it to prevent himself from failing to find the ingredient that he
would need at a crucial moment.
Relying on his unique traits in mysticism, he quickly finished memorizing
them and walked toward the door.
Suddenly, he saw a somewhat familiar figure in the corner of his eyes.
It was a young lady in a casual green dress. Her smooth black hair was soft
and glistening. She had a round face with long eyes. They gave her a sweet
look and a refined bearing.
It’s the girl who was shivering strangely on the public carriage? She does
seem fine… I never expected her to be a mysticism enthusiast… Klein
slowed down and thought for a few seconds before finally recalling who
she was.
He had to admit that, other than Justice who he had never seen clearly, the
young lady was the most beautiful girl he had seen ever since he
transmigrated into this world.
The sweet and refined girl stood before a stall that sold mysticism books
and, in a breach of etiquette, kneeled to rub her fingers against an ancient
book.
The ancient book was bound with a black hardcover. The book cover had
the words “Book of Witches” in Hermes.
“It records the black magic of witches. Although I haven’t dared to try
them, someone I know did, and it really worked.” The vendor seized the
opportunity to promote the book.
The beautiful lady thought and asked, “In your mind, what does a witch
look like?”
“A witch? A wicked person who brings calamities, disease, and pain,” the
vendor answered after some thought.
Klein didn’t hear their conversation because he had already quickly walked
out the front entrance. He was rushing to the Deweyville Library in a hurry
to settle everything before returning home to cook dinner for his brother
and sister. Tomato Oxtail Soup was on the menu.
…
Backlund. Crown Turf Club.
Audrey Hall wore a long white dress with engageantes and ruffled edges, as
well as lace around her chest. She stood in a VIP room and watched the
horses gallop.
She wore a veiled hat decorated with blue ribbons and silk flowers, and a
pair of light colored fishnet gloves. Her cold and distant gaze seemed out of
place in the bustling venue.
Just as the racehorse breasted the tape, her friend Viscount Glaint came
closer and said with a suppressed voice, “Audrey, every time I see you, you
look beautiful from a different angle.”
“How can I help you?” In the past, Audrey might have basked in the young
man’s compliment, but now she could see Glaint’s ulterior motives through
his speech and attitude.
Due to the early passing of Glaint’s father, he had inherited his title of
nobility at the age of twenty. He was a slightly skinny young man. He
looked to the left and right, then chuckled softly as he said, “Audrey, I
know a real Beyonder, a Beyonder that doesn’t belong to the royal family.”
You’ve disappointed me every time you said that… Audrey looked forward
and replied elegantly, “Really?”
“I swear on my father’s name. I have seen his Beyonder powers,” Glaint
replied with whisper.
Audrey was no longer the same as before in which should be excited over
the news. She was now a Beyonder, but to prevent Glaint from turning
suspicious, she widened her eyes and faked a surprised smile. She asked
with her voice trembling, “When can I see him?”
Yes, it’d be great to meet other Beyonders. I can’t just solve every triviality
through the Tarot Club… Besides, I must gather my own resources to
exchange them with Mr. Fool and Mr. Hanged Man… Not everything can be
solved with money… Sigh, now that I’ve sent out the thousand pounds, I’ll
have to be more frugal…
Glaint was very satisfied with Audrey’s response. He looked towards the
racecourse and said, “Tomorrow afternoon, there will be a literature and
music salon at my place.”
…
Inside Deweyville Library.
Klein took out his identity card and badge from his pocket and showed
them to the few librarians.
“I am a probationary inspector from the Special Operations Department of
the Awwa County Police. I need your cooperation in an investigation,” he
said in a deep voice, recalling the police films that he used to watch.
The librarians looked at the identity card and badge before exchanging
looks and nodding at each other.
“Go ahead and ask, Officer.”
Klein recited the names of the journals like New Archeology and upon
finishing, he said, “I want the borrowing records of the journal for the last
two months.”
He realized that one of the librarians had attended to him before, but it was
obvious that the man didn’t recognize him.
“Alright. Hold on a second.” The librarians started searching and quickly
found the recent borrowing records.
Klein flipped through the records seriously, looking for the man who had
borrowed the same journal as he did.
There weren’t many names since there was only one. He had borrowed the
journal several times, including the issue that Klein knew of. The earliest
entry was at the end of May, and the most recent one was last Saturday, a
day before Hanass Vincent’s death.
Klein ran his finger over the borrower’s information and memorized it.
