Chapter 22

: Starting Sequence
After he went up the stairs and returned to the reception hall, Klein was
about to bid Rozanne farewell when he heard the brown-haired girl mention
briskly, “Captain says that you can come on Monday. He wants you to settle
your household affairs first.”
“…Alright.” Klein never expected the Nighthawks’ management to be so
humane and accommodating. It made him feel a little grateful.
He was planning on waking early the next morning and make use of the
opportunity to “wander around” to visit Tingen University. He planned on
informing the staff in charge of the interview that he was not participating
in the follow-up interviews. After all, he had originally obtained the
opportunity to make the interview because of his professor’s
recommendation letter. Regardless, it was basic courtesy to have formal
closure. Even if it was not for himself, he had to respect his mentor’s
efforts.
And in a world without telephones, where telegrams were charged by the
character, and the fact that it would be too late to send a letter, he felt that
taking the public carriage to the university was the most economical and
suitable solution.
Having received the Captain’s special approval, Klein did not need to tire
himself out. He could wake up late and still make his way there on time.
Klein was just about to take off his hat to bid Rozanne farewell when he
suddenly thought of something. He looked around and suppressed his voice.
“Rozanne, do you know what the starting point of the Church’s complete
Sequence is?”
He had forgotten to ask Old Neil.
Rozanne’s eyes widened as she looked at Klein in astonishment. “You wish
to become a Beyonder?”
Was I that obvious? Klein’s body language betrayed him as he answered in
embarrassment, “Having learned that extraordinary and mysterious powers
exist in the world, it’s inevitable that I have some yearnings for it.”
“Oh my Goddess. Do you know how dangerous it is? Didn’t Captain tell
you? The enemies of Beyonders are not just cultists or dark warlocks, but
themselves! People lose control nearly every year. Some even end up
sacrificing themselves! Aren’t you going to consider how your family will
feel?” Rozanne’s hand gestures amplified her tone as her reaction appeared
overly agitated. “Klein, I think the better choice is to be a civilian staff.
There’s nearly no danger, and our salary increases every year. After a few
years of work, you will have saved up much money, allowing you to rent a
bungalow in the North Borough or in the suburbs. You can then marry a
rich and charming lady and have a wonderful family, having adorable and
naughty little angels…”
“Rozanne, stop! Hold up!” Klein hurriedly stopped her in exasperation
when he realized that she was changing the subject. “I just want to… to,
well, understand the basics for now.”
“Alright…” Rozanne fell silent for a few seconds as she lowered her gaze,
feeling somewhat sorry. “Due to what happened to my father, whenever I
face similar problems, I tend to be… well, you know, a little agitated.
However, to be honest, I’m filled with respect towards any man or woman
who willingly wishes to be a Nighthawk.”
“I understand, I understand,” echoed Klein.
Rozanne blinked her light brown eyes and added, “My father once said that
one should never think that they can resolve hidden risks or combat danger
by simply becoming more powerful or a higher Sequencer. In fact, it’s the
opposite. They will encounter more terrifying matters. When facing the
unknown or a terrifying existence, death and insanity are the only two
outcomes. Heh, he ended up sacrificing himself two weeks after saying
that… Klein, don’t look at me with pity. My life is great now, really great!
It’s only right to feel fear towards these matters!”
“I only want to know the basics…” Klein repeated his previous reply, not
sure whether he should laugh or cry.
Captain explained it more clearly than you. And even if I do not become a
Beyonder, I have already encountered something extraordinary… “Alright,”
said Rozanne ruminatively. “I’ve heard Captain’s and Old Neil’s
conversation before. As extraordinary creatures are declining or going
extinct, few high Sequencers exist in this era. It’s already very impressive to
become a Beyonder! Combining our Tingen City and the suburbs, there are
hundreds of thousands of people or maybe even more. Yet, there are only
about thirty plus Beyonders. Well, it’s just my guess… I’m not counting the
cultists and dark warlocks who hide in the dark…”
Without waiting for Klein’s reply, she seemed to regain her vibrancy as she
clenched her fist and brought it to her chest.
“And among these thirty plus Beyonders, most of them are at Sequence 9!
Uh, it seems I have gone off topic…”
“It’s okay. That was something I wanted to know as well.” Klein wished
that Rozanne could be like her usual self, revealing more information as she
rambled on.
“Anyways, it’s already very, very impressive to become a Beyonder!”
Rozanne repeated herself. “The starting Sequence of our Church’s complete
Sequence is Sleepless: Sequence 9, Sleepless!”
Indeed… Klein nodded as he watched Rozanne finding hard to stop herself
from describing in detail.
“You should be able to guess from the name. A Sleepless is someone who
does not need to sleep at night. Three to four hours of rest in the day would
be sufficient. Man, I’m so envious… No, not at all! Sleep is a gift bestowed
upon us by the Goddess. It’s the truest bliss!
“Where was I? Ah, right. A Sleepless can see through the darkness even
without any lights. The deeper into the night, the more powerful they
become. I mean more powerful in the aspects of their physical strength,
their intuition, and their mental capabilities. However, although they can
detect unknown dangers that lurk in the dark, they will still rely on demon
hunting bullets and other items to handle monsters they are unable to deal
with via normal means. My father was once a Sleepless.”
Without waiting for Klein to press on, Rozanne continued, “After that, it’s
Sequence 8’s Midnight Poet, and one level higher is Sequence 7’s
Nightmare.”
Nightmare? Klein instantly recalled that Dunn Smith had guided his
dreams. He asked as a confirmation, “Captain?”
“You know about it?” Rozanne’s mouth nearly turned into an “O” shape.
“Captain once entered my dream…” Klein glanced around as he lowered
his voice once more.
“Got it…” Rozanne was enlightened as she answered with a whisper.
She picked up a coffee cup beside her and took a sip before saying
wistfully, “There are only two Sequence 7 Beyonders in our Tingen City’s
Church. It’s likely that Captain is one of them. Even if he goes to a large
diocese like Backlund, he is still an impressive figure. Some deacons might
not even be stronger than he is!”
“So Captain is that impressive.” Klein echoed with a smiled.
Frankly, Dunn Smith’s appearance last night had left a deep impression on
him. He had basically believed that Dunn was an extremely powerful
Beyonder.
“Of course!” Rozanne proudly straightened her back.
In moments, the scatterbrained her said with a vexed expression, “As for
what’s above Sequence 7, I have no idea. Among all the Nighthawks,
perhaps only Captain will know.”
“Then what about other starting Sequences? The ones that aren’t
complete?” Klein was satisfied as he changed the subject.
It had to be said that Rozanne’s description of Sleepless did match his
imaginations and expectations of Beyonders. However, it was not the kind
he wished to become. The perfect Sequence 9 was likely one that could
study and grasp more knowledge of the mystery. By doing so, he could
leverage on them to figure out the reason for his transmigration and lay the
foundations of his future transmigration back.
Rozanne thought for a moment before saying with a sigh, “I’m not that
interested in this aspect. I only know we have more than other churches.
After all, the Goddess is the Mother of the Secrets… Well, there should be
two or three. Some of our teammates are cold and distant, making me fear
them. They also have a strange smell to them. Some members… Well, I
mean you should talk to Old Neil. He knows a lot, as well as quite a number
of interesting magical rituals. Let me think. He once mentioned his
Sequence 9 title, which is also the name of the potion formula… Ah, yes,
it’s called Mystery Pryer.”
Quite a number of interesting magical rituals? Mystery Pryer sounds very
close to what I want… Klein was slightly delighted.
“In addition, I also know of the name of a Sequence 7, the kind that’s
incomplete!” Rozanne said with a flaunting tone. She had just thought of it
while recollecting.
“What is it?” Klein was abnormally curious.
In a world where high Sequencers were scarce to the point of them possibly
not existing, Sequence 7 was probably considered quite a potent force in the
Church.
Rozanne revealed a sweet smile as she replied smugly, “Spirit Medium!”
“Mdm. Daly?” asked Klein subconsciously.
After his initial surprise, he realized that it was nothing unexpected. Only a
Sequence 7 Beyonder could achieve such an impressive performance as a
medium!
Rozanne’s eyes widened once again as she said in disbelief, “H-how do you
know of that too?”
“I’ve met Mdm. Daly.” Klein did not hide the matter.
“Alright,” said Rozanne with an envious tone. “If I can become a Spirit
Medium, one just like Mdm. Daly, then I’ll be willing to be a Beyonder. No,
I’ll consider it carefully for ten minutes…”
“Yes, Mdm. Daly fulfills all my imaginations as a Beyonder,” echoed Klein
in a slightly exaggerated manner.
Having fulfilled his goals, he chatted idly with Rozanne for a few minutes
until he realized he was not getting any new information. He took of his hat
and bowed before leaving.
As he walked down the stairs, Klein suddenly stopped after taking a few
steps. He reached out to pad the notes in his inner pocket.
Immediately following that, he took out twelve gold pound notes and
clenched then tightly in his left palm. Then, he reached his hand into his
pocket and refused to release or pull them out again. Without realizing it, a
smile appeared on his face.
