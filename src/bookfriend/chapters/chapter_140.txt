Chapter 140

: Expert At Courting Death
“The origins of this drop of golden liquid.”
After reciting the divination statement seven times, Klein held onto the
goatskin and the illusory golden liquid before leaning back in his seat.
He didn’t know if he could divine with the item that was instantiated based
purely on a feeling. All he could do was make bold assumptions and
carefully seek confirmation.
In seconds, Klein’s eyes darkened, turning from brown to black as he
entered a state of Cogitation.
His eyelids drooped down and he “saw” the illusory yet blurry dream.
In the blurry world that looked in shambles, a golden, glaring sun suddenly
appeared!
A low grunt resounded across the void. The pure and clean light suddenly lit
everything up as the gold and burning flames swept outwards.
Boom!
Klein was instantly expelled from his dreamworld and flipped onto his side
as he shivered. His body seemed to become a huge bonfire which burned
with a raging flame.
At that moment, his thoughts were all over the place. No proper idea could
form from the chaos in his mind.
Rumble!
The mysterious space above the gray fog shook violently, and the lofty
palace collapsed inch by inch. The ancient, mottled bronze table broke into
a few pieces.
The terrifying changes only continued for three seconds before the world
above the gray fog returned to tranquility as though nothing had happened.
The gold flame on Klein gradually extinguished. He rolled around on his
charred skin as he groaned in pain, until he eventually regained his ability
to think.
He supported himself on the armrest of the high chair and stood up with
great difficulty. He was terrified and confused about what had just
happened.
He had never imagined that a mere divination would result in such
consequences!
He panted and lifted his head to survey his surroundings. He realized that
the lofty palace and ancient bronze table, which looked like they had stood
unchanged since ancient times, had been damaged. In the world above the
gray fog, which had never experienced any abnormality, it was simply an
unprecedented level of damage.
What happened? Did my divination point towards some unfathomable
existence?Klein calmed down slightly and let his burned flesh shed while
he speculated. If I wasn’t protected by this mysterious space above the gray
fog, there might not even be ashes of me left behind… Could that drop of
gold liquid be the blood of a god? Did I see the Eternal Blazing Sun, or
some powerful angel of His? No, that was the sun, so I think it was the
former… Damn, did I just look directly at a god?
Klein felt more fear as he thought about it. He felt that he had nearly died.
Those who know nothing fear nothing, but those who don’t court death
won’t die… In the future, I can’t just divine anything and everything. Who
knows what I’ll see!
If that were to happen once more, I don’t know if this mysterious space
could even shelter me from fatal damage… When that happens, I’d actually
die…
Yes, it definitely won’t do if I continue making experiments with the golden
liquid. The existence from before which was likely Eternal Blazing Sun. He
must have sensed the sudden, hidden and unexpected influence from the
divination above the gray fog and failed to respond in time… If He were
prepared, this mysterious space might not have been able to withstand the
repercussions…
Having come to this realization, Klein’s body had already returned to
normal. It was no longer charred, but compared to before, he was dimmer
and more incorporeal than before.
He lifted his hand to massage his temples and commanded with his mind to
restore the palace and the long table.
Then, the palace that looked like the home of a giant and the long table cast
out of bronze returned to normal. Everything looked like it had before.
Klein sat down and leaned against the back of the chair. He mocked himself
and said,
Well, this isn’t entirely bad. At least I know the limit of the mysterious space
and I have a certain goal… Only powers approaching the angels of the
gods can completely influence the power of the area above the gray fog?
Sigh, I have to add another new rule to my Seer principle. ‘Do not
randomly divine things that involve a high-level entity.’ Yes, I shouldn’t
hastily activate my Spirit Vision either. If I were to look directly at things
that shouldn’t be looked at directly, it might be game over. In the outside
world, I don’t have the mysterious space to fend off most of the negative
effects…
After a while, Klein’s expression turned odd because some knowledge was
reverberating in his head.
Yes, knowledge!
In the short time he had spent with what appeared to be Eternal Blazing
Sun, Klein was constantly in his divination state. Hence, he could
instinctively divine certain matters and knowledge from the being that he
was looking at.
He quickly used a dream divination to recall and organize what he had
gathered that wasn’t his primary objective. He picked up the black fountain
pen and wrote one line after another.
“1. Do not look directly at God.
“2. Pure white angel.
“3. The technique of making a Flaring Sun Charm… It’s a relatively high
level charm in the domain of the Sun. Its potency can last a year before it
deteriorates… There’s no need for a ritual to pray to the Eternal Blazing
Sun, but the procedure requires the Sealed Artifact 3-0782 to take the
ritual’s place. It will siphon power from the Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem…
“4. Extremely hostile towards Lord of Storms and God of Knowledge and
Wisdom.
“5. Bard potion formula:
Main ingredients: a Crystal Sunflower or an adult Flint Bird’s tail feather or
a Fire Bird’s tail feather… A piece of Siren Rock or a Singing Sunflower…
Supplementary ingredients: a blade of Midsummer Grass, 5 drops of July
Wine Juice, a blade of Elf Dark Leaf…
“6. Light Suppliant potion formula:
Main ingredients: a piece of Brilliance Rock or powder of Dazzling Soul
or… Blood of a Mirror Hedgehog or the Heart of a Magma Titan…
Supplementary ingredients: a Golden-edged Sunflower, three drops of
Aconite Juice…
“7. Priest of Light potion formula:
Information of main ingredients missing.
Supplementary ingredients: 5 grams of Rosemary, 7 drops of fingered citron
juices, Rock Water…
“8. Sequence 4, Unshadowed potion formula. Main ingredients could be the
golden blood of god extracted from the Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem. It
could also be replaced with three adult Sun Divine Bird’s tail feathers and a
piece of Holy Brilliance Rock.
Information of supplementary ingredients missing…”
After writing down the eight lines, Klein couldn’t help but rap the edge of
the long bronze table.
He had gained way more than he imagined!
He was already satisfied with surviving his reckless divination earlier, but
now he had received an unexpected “survival reward.”
From the confidential information he received from the Nighthawks, he
knew that the Sequence pathway that the Church of the Eternal Blazing Sun
held was called Sun, and its Sequence 9 was Bard. It would allow the
Beyonder to imbue courage and strength for themselves and their allies
through their singing, a “job” that brought about devotion and submission.
Their slogan was “Let us praise the Sun!”
The corresponding Sequence 8 was Light Suppliant. They could cast spells
and hold rituals from the Sun’s domain which were very effective against
corpses and spirits. Sequence 7 was called Solar High Priest, which greatly
enhanced the spells and rituals within its domain.
In other words, I have obtained the complete potion formulas of Sequence 9
and Sequence 8 in the Sun Sequence pathway. Yes, unlike before, the potion
formula even lists replacement items and ingredient names from different
eras… As expected of formulas obtained directly from Eternal Blazing Sun
through divination! Klein thought in satisfaction.
He had originally planned on seeing if The Hanged Man could solve the
request of the young man from the City of Silver. After all, the Church of
the Lord of Storms and the Church of the Eternal Blazing Sun were the
most ancient orthodox sects. They had fought against each other for
thousands of years, so it would only make sense for the two churches to
have learned the initial sequence of each other’s pathways.
The Hanged Man might not have cared about the Sun pathway previously,
but since he is very likely a Sequence 7 Seafarer, it would probably be easy
for him if he really needed to gather the information. However, I don’t need
him now. I solved it myself, through an unbelievable yet extremely
dangerous method… Miss Justice, Mr. Hanged Man, my Sun friend, your
Fool nearly turned himself into a charred corpse… Klein lampooned
silently while still feeling a lingering sense of fear.
He lowered his head and looked at the records on the goatskin before him.
He thought of another formula.
Would the Priest of Light be an ancient name of Solar High Priest? The
confidential information of the Nighthawks never mentioned it, and my
divination didn’t pinpoint the Sequence number… Is it Sequence 6, or
Sequence 5?
Sequence 4, Unshadowed… This is the first High-Sequence formula that
I’ve obtained! It’s such a pity that it lacks the supplementary ingredients. I
wonder how I can fill in the blanks? I can’t believe that drop of golden
liquid is really the blood of a god. Sealed Artifact 3-0782 is probably far
stronger than anyone imagines. From what I can see, it’s sufficient to
become a Grade 1 Sealed Artifact.
Yes, it’s likely that the Nighthawks from before only determined whether the
item has any traits of the living, how much danger it would cause to nearby
humans, how difficult it is to control the item’s effects, and if it can be used
against corpses and spirits. They had no way of discovering its unique
origin.
The Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem can probably even fight against evil
spirits… How could the examiner find an evil spirit to experiment on?
As an official Nighthawk, I can’t become the owner of Sealed Artifact 3-
0782, but, yes, I can find an opportunity to make a Flaring Sun Charm and
siphon its power? Sigh. I certainly can’t do it now. I haven’t prepared the
necessary ingredients. Why would I, a Nighthawk of the Evernight Goddess,
carry the ingredients of the Sun around with me?
Klein massaged his forehead regrettably. He saw that there was no other
movement in the world above the gray fog and finally relaxed. He
confirmed that the Eternal Blazing Sun hadn’t managed to track him down.
Do not look directly at God, do not look directly at a high-level entity. I
must remember this!
Why would the Eternal Blazing Sun be extremely hostile towards the Lord
of Storms and the God of Knowledge and Wisdom?
What the hell is a pure white angel?
…
As these mixed thoughts filled his brain, Klein felt the emptiness and an
aching pain in his head. Plus, he felt that too much time had passed. He had
to return to the outer world, just in case someone discovered anything
amiss.
Back then, he thought it would take a minute or so to divine two or three
times in the mysterious space. Plus, there was a spirituality wall isolating
him from everything else. Once it was touched, his body in the world above
the gray fog would sense it. Hence, he felt utterly safe, but he hadn’t
considered the possibility of having some sort of accident. In the end, he
nearly lost his life and that wasted quite a bit of time.
Due to the fact that he was afraid that he would be greeted by a Light of
Purification beam or discover that the Mutated Sun Sacred Emblem was
damaged, he enveloped his body with spirituality before he stimulated a
descent with his heart in his mouth.
The crimson moonlight reflected in his eyes, and there was a darkness
hidden within. Klein saw the sparse forest and the weeds before him, as
well as the intact Sealed Artifact 3-0782 in his hands.
After a few seconds of breathless anxiety, he finally believed that he was
safe.
Phew… Klein let out a breath of relief. He felt exhausted after his insane
probing at the border of death.
