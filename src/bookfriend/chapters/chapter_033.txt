Chapter 33

: Switch
The moment Old Neil finished his sentence, the illusory pair of eyes that
lurked in the darkness behind him vanished. Even in his Spirit Vision state,
Klein was no longer able to identify traces of its existence.
“This is a characteristic of ritualistic magic,” explained Old Neil with a
chuckle.
Fascinating… Is Spirit Vision an enhanced version of Yin-Yang eyes? Klein
felt like a child who had received a new toy. In excitement, he turned his
gaze way and began observing every corner of the room. He wanted to see
the differences of the alchemy room with and without the Spirit Vision.
The outlines of the objects in the dark such as the tables, test tubes, scales,
cups, and cupboards did not look different from how it looked like without
Spirit Vision. They did not emit any lights or colors.
Objects without lives do not have any spirituality? Klein mumbled to
himself as he swept his gaze toward the silver chest.
Suddenly, he saw a vibrancy of colors. The colors were as blue as the sky,
as resplendent as the stars, or as crimson red as burning flames!
“Materials from extraordinary beings still have some life in them, and uh…
are still active? Even if the source is already dead?” Klein deliberated on his
words as he sought Old Neil’s help.
“A precise description is that they have remnant spiritualities. It is one of
the crucial points of a successful potion concoction. It is also one the
reasons why a Beyonder will lose control. Dunn should have already
informed you,” explained Old Neil frankly.
He suddenly laughed, having recalled something.
“I remember that the formula of Corpse Collector requires a desiccated
mature black-spotted frog. To consume that potion requires a lot of
courage.”
Klein imagined a little and found it disgusting. He did not echo Old Neil’s
words and turned his gaze to a dark area. However, there were no spiritual
bodies or ghosts that he looked forward to seeing.
“Isn’t it said that the world of spirits is everywhere?” he asked out of
curiosity.
Old Neil chuckled tersely before saying, “Punk, repeat after me.
“This is the headquarters of a Nighthawk squad. This is the ground beneath
the Church of the Evernight Goddess. There are many Beyonders in here!
“Do you think we will allow spirits and souls to wander around in here?
Furthermore, the spiritual world and spirit are two different concepts.”
Klein felt a little embarrassed as he turned his head, pretending to look at
the faint light from the gas lamps at the entrance.
“I get it.”
While speaking, the area between his brows began to spasm.
What’s happening? Just as Klein turned around to ask, he suddenly saw a
figure standing quietly by the door at the periphery of the light. It appeared
human, though its aura’s colors and the darkness blended perfectly, making
it impossible to discern.
Hiss!
Klein felt a painful spasm at his glabella 1 . His vision turned chaotic as he
focused his attention again, but there was no “formless” figure!
Strange… He turned around and asked.
“Mr. Neil, the spot in between my brows is a little painful from spasms.”
“Haha, this is very common. You are a new Beyonder. Spirit Vision places a
great burden on your Spirit Body. Furthermore, it drains you constantly.
Physical effects can be glabella spasms, headaches, oversensitivity, and
minor bouts of hallucinations. And while viewing things with Spirit Vision,
it’s very easy to feel uncomfortable as a result of the unfamiliar
surroundings. It’s also very easy to have your emotions affected by others.
These are things that require you to pay attention. You can become
accustomed to and eliminate them with repeated practice. In addition, use it
sparingly and end it in a timely fashion,” answered Old Neil with a smile.
Why does it feel like you are delighted by this… Klein hurriedly asked for
advice, “Then, how do I exit from the state of having Spirit Vision?”
He had planned on mentioning the invisible figure he had seen, though
when he heard of the minor bouts of hallucination among the symptoms, he
struck that thought away.
From the glabella spasm and headache, he could completely guess Old
Neil’s answer!
“Like before, think of an item to divert your attention. It will bring you out
of Cogitation. Close your eyes and control your spirituality and repeatedly
tell it to end. When you open your eyes again, you will discover that your
Spirit Vision has ended.”
Old Neil described leisurely and when he was done, added, “Of course, that
is the most trivial and clumsy method. We can repeatedly hint to ourselves
in Cogitation from practice to affect our spirituality. That way, you will
have a simple switch. For instance, tapping at your glabella twice lightly
would allow you easily activate Spirit Vision. Another two taps will simply
end it. As for how you set it up, it depends on your habits and preferences.
“Got it.” Klein thought for a moment and planned to imitate Old Neil to use
tapping his glabella twice as a switch for his Spirit Vision.
Tapping once was easily mistaken as an instinctive knock to his head and
tapping thrice could be a waste of valuable time in dangerous situations. As
for actions like snapping fingers, they were too attention-drawing.
He eased his focus and imagined the stacked spheres of light and re-entered
a state of Cogitation.
Under Old Neil’s guidance, after repeated hints and practice, he finally “set
up” his “switch.”
He clenched his fist slightly and used his index finger’s joint to tap at his
glabella twice. Immediately, there were glowing auras of differing thickness
and colors appearing before his eyes.
After another two taps, everything returned to normal.
“I’ve finally grasped it…” he sighed with delight.
Only then did he realize how exhausted he was, feeling like he could fall
asleep at any time. His mind hurt as though he had stayed up for three
nights.
Old Neil said with a chuckle, “We are not Sleepless. Every practice and
every time Spirit Vision is used excessively, you will need some sleep. You
can now go back and have a good rest. In the afternoon, go to Iron Cross
Street where Welch’s place is and walk around. Try your best to find clues
about the Antigonus family’s notebook as soon as possible. Tomorrow, I’ll
continue teaching you about mysticism. Of course, do not forget to read the
historical documents.”
“Alright.” Klein was in full agreement with Old Neil’s arrangements.
He picked up his cane and left the alchemy room. He watched the door
close as Old Neil returned to the armory. Klein massaged his glabella and
temples and with the help of his cane, sauntered up the stairwell.
At that moment, Dunn Smith came from behind him with the corners of his
lips hooked. With a deep gaze, he said, “I heard from Old Neil that you are
a very suitable candidate. Even without Cogitation, you were able to use
Spirit Vision.”
“Perhaps, it’s a unique trait of being a Seer,” replied Klein humbly.
He guessed that Dunn had been watching the armory for Old Neil.
Dunn slowed down and went ahead of Klein a little. After a few seconds of
silence, he turned around and said, “You have to remember that curiosity
killed the cat. It can also kill Beyonders. Do not attempt to probe the
murmurings you should not be listening or see existences you should not
see.”
“Alright.” Klein knew this was another reminder of how Beyonders lost
control.
After entering Blackthorn Security Company, he greeted Rozanne who
obviously did not know that he had become a Beyonder. He slowly walked
out the door and reached the streets where he took a trackless carriage to
Daffodil Street. He nearly fell asleep on his return journey.
It was still in the morning and the temperature was about twenty-six degree
Celsius. Klein pulled out a copper key from his waistband and opened the
door to his home.
There were still many items missing from his home. The living room and
dining hall were still empty. Benson and Melissa had work or school, so
they had both left early in the morning.
Klein did not have the capacity to bother with anything else. He closed the
door and briskly went to the second floor and entered the bookshelf-
equipped bedroom that belonged to him.
After taking off his tuxedo and hanging it on a clothing rack, he eagerly
plunged into bed. The moment his head hit the pillow, he fell asleep.
Klein was awoken by bright sunlight. He turned his head and slowly opened
his eyes to discover the burning sun outside.
“What time is it? Did I miss the Tarot Club in the afternoon?” He struggled
to get up and walked to the clothing rack to take out his pocket watch from
the pocket of the tuxedo’s inner lining.
Not only had he forgotten about the matter, he had forgotten to close the
door to his bedroom and pulled the curtains to the oriel window.
Pa!
Klein pulled out the pocket watch and immediately felt relieved when he
opened it.
It was only slightly past noon. There was still a lot of time until the
scheduled gathering at three in the afternoon.
It was Monday, the day he would have a gathering with The Hanged Man
and Justice.
Klein went into thought as he tapped his glabella twice. The scene before
him changed once again as he saw that his body had restored to a bright
luster.
He tapped twice again and stopped his Spirit Vision. Relaxed, he went to
the first floor and boiled a kettle of water. He placed some inferior-quality
tea leaves and chewed on some rye bread dabbed in a little butter.
Afterwards, Klein flipped through historical materials and original Klein’s
diary. He began ‘revising’ and consolidating his knowledge.
…
At 2:57pm, Klein closed his book and capped his fountain pen before
pulling the curtains.
Immediately following that, he locked the bedroom’s door, making the
room turn abnormally dark.
He tapped his glabella twice and activated Spirit Vision to survey his
surroundings.
After confirming that there were no invisible spiritual bodies in his room,
Klein stopped the Spirit Vision and took out his pocket watch to check the
time.
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
One minute before three, he opened up his pace and like before, walked
four steps in a counter-clockwise manner in a squarish shape. He incanted
in Chinese softly.
Only this time, he did not prepare any staple food.
Klein closed his eyes as he felt the back of his hands turn itchy. It felt like
the four black docks forming a square was protruding and projecting
something.
Hysterical shouts and alluring murmurs began resounding, but Klein
realized that the headache was not as bad as the first time.
It was not that he was unaffected, but that he was doing his best to stop
himself from listening.
As a Beyonder, he had to have more self-control in such an environment.
Soon, his body turned light as he floated up. He saw the grayish-white and
blurry fog that emanated. Then, he saw dark red ‘stars.’ Two of them had a
minuscule connection with him with an abnormal sense of familiarity.
Klein looked at his blurry self and muttered in confusion, “The Astral
Projection that Old Neil mentioned?”
He remained calm for a few seconds and again transformed the opulent
divine palace with the tall bronze table under the domed ceiling, as well as
the twenty-two high-back chairs that corresponded to the different
constellations.
Klein calmly walked to the Seat of Honor and made his body and face be
immersed in thicker gray fog. He extended his right hand and tapped two
familiar deep-red stars and created a miraculous connection.
