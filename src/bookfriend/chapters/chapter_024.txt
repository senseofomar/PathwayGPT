Chapter 24

: Penny-pincher
The sky outside was gradually dyed golden as Klein looked into Melissa’s
eyes. He was momentarily at a loss for words; none of the lines he prepared
could be used.
He coughed lightly twice as he quickly racked his brains.
“Melissa, this isn’t a waste of salary. In the future, my colleagues, as well as
Benson’s colleagues might visit. Are we going to host them in such a place?
When Benson and I get married and have wives, are we still going to sleep
in bunk beds?”
“None of you have fiancées yet, right? We can wait a little while and save
up more money in the meantime,” answered Melissa in a logically concise
manner.
“No, Melissa. This is a societal rule.” Klein was stumped and could only
count on lofty principles. “Since I’m earning three pounds a week, I should
look like I’m earning three pounds a week.”
To be honest, having rented an apartment before with others, Zhou Mingrui
was no stranger to his present living conditions as Klein. He was very used
to it, but it was because of his past experience that he knew how
inconvenient such an environment was for a girl. Furthermore, his goal was
to become a Beyonder and study mysticism to find his way home. In the
future, he was bound to conduct some magical rituals at home. Having too
many people in the apartment building made incidents prone to happen.
Klein saw that Melissa was about to continue arguing, and hurriedly added,
“Don’t worry. I’m not planning to get a bungalow, but probably a terrace.
Basically, it has to have a bathroom we can call ours. Also, I like Mrs.
Smyrin’s bread, Tingen biscuits, and lemon cakes too. We can first consider
places near Iron Cross Street and Daffodil Street.”
Melissa pouted her lips slightly and fell silent for a moment before nodding
slowly.
“Besides, I’m in no rush to move either. We have to wait for Benson to
return,” said Klein with a chuckle. “We can’t have him be shocked when he
opens the door to find nothing, right? Imagine him saying in astonishment
—’Where are my things? Where are my siblings? Where’s my home? Is this
my home? Did I make a mistake? Goddess, wake me up if this is a dream.
Why is my home gone after a few days of absence!?'”
His mimicking of Benson’s tone made Melissa involuntarily smile as her
eyes scrunched up and revealed her shallow dimples.
“No, Mr. Franky would definitely be waiting by the door to get Benson to
hand over the apartment keys. Benson wouldn’t even be able to come up.”
The girl disparaged the miserly landlord.
In the Moretti household, all of them would like to make Mr. Franky the
butt of their jokes for every trivial and major matter. It was all thanks to
Benson who initiated this practice.
“Right, there’s no way he would switch locks for the tenants after us,” Klein
echoed with a smile. He pointed at the door and quipped, “Miss Melissa,
shall we head to Silver Crown Restaurant for a celebration?”
Melissa sighed gently and said, “Klein, do you know Selena? My classmate
and my good friend?”
Selena? An image of a girl with wine-red hair and deep brown eyes
surfaced in Klein’s mind. Her parents were Evernight Goddess believers.
They had named her after St. Selena as a blessing. She was not yet sixteen,
and was half a year younger than Melissa. She was a happy, cheerful, and
outgoing lady.
“Yes.” Klein nodded in affirmation.
“Her elder brother, Chris, is a lawyer. He currently earns close to three
pounds a week as well. His fiancée works part time as a typist,” described
Melissa. “They have been engaged for more than four years. To ensure a
decent and stable life after marriage, they are still saving money to this very
day. They have yet to go down the wedding aisle and plan to wait for at
least another year. According to Selena, there are many people like her
brother. They typically get married after twenty-eight. You have to be make
advanced preparations and save up. Don’t squander your money.”
It’s just a meal at a restaurant. Is there a need to preach at me… Klein was
rendered at a loss whether to laugh or cry. After a few seconds of thought,
he said, “Melissa, I’m already earning three pounds a week, and I’ll have
increments every year. There’s no need for you to worry.”
“But we need to save some money in the case of any unexpected
emergencies. For example, what if that security company suddenly closes
down? I have a classmate whose father’s company went bankrupt. He had
to find temporary work at the pier and their living conditions turned terrible
instantly. She had no choice but to quit school,” advised Melissa with a
serious expression.
… Klein extended his hand to cover his face. “T-that security company and
the government… Yes, has some connections with the government. It will
not easily close down.”
“But even the government isn’t stable. After every election, if the party in
power changes, many people will have their positions stripped off. It turns
into a mess.” Melissa retorted in an unyielding manner.
…Sis, you sure know a lot… Klein found the humor in his exasperation as
he shook his head. “Alright then…
“Then I’ll boil some soup with the leftovers from yesterday. Buy some pan-
fried fish, a slab of black-pepper beef, a small bottle of butter, and a cup of
malt beer for me. Anyway, there should still be some celebration.”
They were commonly sold items by hawkers on Iron Cross Street. A piece
of pan-fried fish was six to eight pence; a not-so-big piece of black-
peppered beef was five pence; a cup of malt beer was a penny; and a bottle
of butter weighing about a quarter pound was four pence, but buying a
pound of butter would only cost one soli three pence.
The original Klein was responsible for buying ingredients during holidays,
so he was no stranger to the prices. Klein did a mental estimate that Melissa
would need about one soli six pence. Therefore, he took out two one-soli
notes.
“Alright.” Melissa did not object to Klein’s proposal. She put down her
backpack of stationery and took the notes.
When he saw his sister taking out a tiny bottle for the butter and pots for the
other food before briskly walking to the door, Klein thought for a moment
and shouted out to her. “Melissa, use the remaining money to buy some
fruits.”
There were many hawkers on Iron Cross Street who would buy low-quality
or expiring fruits from other places. The residents were not outraged about
this because the prices were extremely cheap. They could taste the
magnificent flavors after removing the rotten parts, so it was a cheap
enjoyment.
With that said, Klein took a few brisk steps forward and took out the
remaining copper pennies from his pocket and stuffed it into his sister’s
palm.
“Ah?” Melissa’s brown eyes looked at her brother in puzzlement.
Klein took two steps back and smiled. “Remember to go to Mrs. Smyrin’s.
Reward yourself with a tiny lemon cake.”
“…” Melissa’s mouth widened as she blinked. Finally, she said a single
word, “Okay.”
She quickly turned around, opened the door, and ran toward the stairwell.
…
A river tore through the land, with cedar and maple trees lining the banks;
the air so fresh, it was intoxicating.
Klein, who was here to put closure to his interview, had his revolver with
him. He held his cane and paid six pence for the public carriage. He walked
down a cemented path and approached a three-story stone building which
was shaded by greenery. It was Tingen University’s administrative block.
“It’s truly worthy of being one of the two major universities of the Loen
Kingdom…” With this being his first time here, Klein sighed as he walked.
Compared to Tingen University, Khoy University right across the river
could only be described as shabby.
“Heave-ho!”
“Heave-ho!”
Voices approached slowly as two rowing boats made their way upstream
across the Khoy River. Oars were being rowed in an orderly and rhythmic
manner.
This was a rowing sport that was popular among all the universities in Loen
Kingdom. With Klein requiring a scholarship to finance his university
studies, he, Welch, and the others had joined Khoy University’s rowing club
and were pretty good at it.
“This is youth…” Klein stopped and looked into the distance before sighing
wistfully.
Such sights would no longer be seen in another week since school would
break for summer.
As he proceeded down a road sheltered by trees, Klein stopped by a three-
story stone building. He entered after successfully registering himself and
easily found his way to the office of the person who had tended to him the
other time.
Knock! Knock! Knock! He knocked lightly on the half-closed door.
“Come in.” A man’s voice sounded from inside.
A middle-aged instructor dressed in a white shirt and black tuxedo frowned
when he saw Klein enter. “There’s another hour until the interview.”
“Mr. Stone, do you still remember me? I’m a student of Senior Associate
Professor Cohen, Klein Moretti. You have read my recommendation letter
before.” Klein smiled as he took off his hat.
Harvin Stone stroked his black beard and asked, puzzled, “Is there
something wrong? I’m not in charge of interviews.”
“Here’s the situation. I’ve already found a job, so I won’t be participating in
the interview today.” Klein gave his reason for coming.
“I see…” When Harvin Stone learned of the reason, he stood up and
reached out his right hand. “Congratulations. You are really a polite lad. I
will inform the professor and senior associate professors.”
Klein shook Harvin’s hand and planned on making a little small talk before
bidding him farewell when he heard a familiar voice behind him.
“Moretti, you found another job?”
Klein turned around and saw an elder with a head of silver hair that left a
deep impression on his silhouette. His deep, blue eyes sunk deep into his
face and he had few wrinkles. The man looked sharp in his black tuxedo.
“Good afternoon, Mentor. Mr. Azik,” he hurriedly greeted. “Why are the
two of you here?”
The elder was none other than Senior Associate Professor of Khoy
University’s history department, who was also his mentor, Mr. Quentin
Cohen. Beside Cohen was a middle-aged man with bronze-colored skin of
average build. He did not have any facial hair and held a newspaper in his
hand. His hair was black and his pupils brown. His facial features were soft
as his eyes revealed an indescribable sense of weariness like it had seen the
vicissitudes of life. Beneath his right ear was a black mole which could only
be seen if looked at carefully.
Khoy University recognized him since he was Khoy University’s history
department lecturer, Mr. Azik, who often helped the original Klein. He
enjoyed debating with his mentor, Senior Associate Professor Cohen. They
often had a clash of opinion, but even so, they were best friends; otherwise,
they would not have enjoyed meeting up for a chat.
Cohen nodded and said with a relaxed tone, “Azik and I are here to
participate in an academic conference. What kind of job did you get?”
“It’s a security company which seeks, collects, and protects ancient relics.
They were in need of a professional consultant and are paying me three
pounds a week.” Klein repeated what he said to his sister yesterday.
Following that, he explained, “As you know, I prefer exploring history,
instead of summarizing it.”
Cohen nodded slightly and said, “Everyone has their own choices. I’m very
happy that you bothered to come to Tingen University to inform them
instead of just not showing up.”
At that moment, Azik interjected, “Klein, do you know what happened to
Welch and Naya? I read on the newspapers that they were killed by
burglars.”
The incident has become a case of armed burglary? And why it is already
on the newspapers? Klein was taken aback as he weighed over his words.
“I’m not very clear of the specifics as well. Welch had obtained a diary of
the Solomon Empire’s Antigonus family from the Fourth Epoch. My help
on interpreting it was sought. I helped them for the first few days, but I later
got busy with job hunting. The police even came to me two days ago.”
He deliberately divulged the matter regarding the Solomon Empire and the
Antigonus family in hopes of getting any information from the two history
teachers.
“The Fourth Epoch…” Cohen muttered with a frown.
The bronze-skinned and weary eyes of Azik went blank first before he
inhaled. He rubbed his temple with his newspaper-wielding left hand and
said, “Antigonus… rings a bell… But why can’t I remember…”
