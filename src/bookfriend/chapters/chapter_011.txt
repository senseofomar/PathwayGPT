Chapter 11

: Real Culinary Skills
The norm is for everyone to die together? Very glad that I’m still alive?
Fortunate that I’m still alive?
Klein shivered and quickly ran to the door, trying to catch up with the
policemen and ask for protection.
But as soon as he reached the handle, he suddenly stopped.
That officer talked so horribly about it, why didn’t they protect me, an
important witness or key lead?
Isn’t that too careless?
Were they just probing me? Or maybe it’s a bait?
All kinds of thoughts rushed into Klein’s mind; he suspected that the police
were still secretly “watching” him, observing his reaction.
He felt much calmer after thinking of this and was no longer so panicked.
He slowly opened the door, deliberately shouting with a trembling voice at
the staircase, “You guys will protect me, right?”
Tap, tap, tap… There was no response from the police officers, and there
was no change in the rhythm of the contact between the leather shoes and
the wooden stairs.
“I know! You’ll do that!” Klein shouted again in a tone of feigned
conviction, trying to act like a normal person that was in danger.
The sound of footsteps gradually weakened and disappeared into the bottom
floor of the apartment.
Klein snorted and laughed, “Isn’t that response too fake? Their acting skills
are not up to standard!”
He did not run after them. Instead, he turned back to the room and closed
the door behind him.
In the next few hours, Klein fully expressed what they called back in
Foodaholic Empire, China—restlessness, nervousness, agitation,
inadvertence and murmuring words that he did not understand. He did not
slack just because there was no one around.
This is called the self-cultivation of an actor! He laughed at himself in his
heart.
When the sun moved to the west, the clouds on the horizon appeared to be
reddish-orange. Tenants in the apartment came home one after another;
Klein shifted his focus elsewhere.
“Melissa is almost done with school…” He looked at the stove, lifted the
kettle, peeled off the coal and took out the revolver.
Without pause or delay, he reached to the back of the board under the
double-decked bed where more than ten wooden strips were staggered out.
After clipping the left wheel between a piece of wooden strip and board,
Klein straightened up and waited uneasily, fearing that the police would
burst open the door and rush into the room with guns in their hands.
If it was an Age of Steam, he was certain he would not be seen by anyone
when he did that. However, there were extraordinary powers here, ones that
he had proven through his own experiences.
After waiting for a few minutes, there was no movement at the door. There
was only the chatter between two tenants who were heading for the Heart of
the Wild Bar on Iron Cross Street.
“Phew.” Klein exhaled, feeling assured.
All he needed to do was wait for Melissa’s return and cook the stewed
mutton with tender peas!
When the idea came to Klein’s mind, his mouth seemed to taste the rich
flavor of the gravy; he remembered how Melissa cooked stewed mutton
with tender peas.
First, she boiled the water and stir-fried the meat. Then, she added onions,
salt, a little pepper, and water. After a specific period of time, the peas and
potatoes were added, and the stew was to be cooked for an additional forty
or fifty minutes with the lid on.
“It’s indeed a simple and crude way to do it… Supported purely by the
flavors of the meat itself!” Klein shook his head.
But there was no other way about it. It was hard for commoners to have
many kinds of condiments and various cooking methods. They could only
pursue simple, practical, and economical methods. As long as the meat was
not burnt or spoiled, anything was good for people who could only eat meat
once or twice a week.
Klein was not a very good cook himself and ordered takeout food most of
the time. But by cooking three or four times a week, after many weeks of
accumulated practice, he had a passing standard and felt that he would not
let the pound of mutton down.
“When Melissa comes back to cook it, it will be done after 7:30pm. She
would be starving by then… It’s time for her to see what real cooking is!”
Klein made an excuse for himself. First, he started the fire again, went to
the bathroom to collect water, and washed the mutton. Then he took out the
kitchen boards and knives before chopping the mutton into tiny chunks.
As for the explanation for his sudden culinary skills, he decided to blame it
on the dead Welch McGovern, who had not only hired a chef who was good
at the Midseashire flavor, but also often created his own delicacies and
invited people to try them.
Well, the dead cannot refute me!
Nevertheless, tsk, this is a world with Beyonders; the dead are not
necessarily unable to speak. With that in mind, Klein was a little guilty
conscience.
He threw aside his confused thoughts and put the meat into the soup bowl.
Then he took out the condiment box and added in a spoonful of the crude
salt, half of which had begun yellowing. In addition, he cautiously took
some black pepper grains from a special small bottle, mixing and
marinating them together.
He placed the saucepan on the stove and, while waiting for it to heat up,
Klein rummaged for the carrots from yesterday and cut them into pieces
with the onions he bought today.
When he was done with his preparations, he took out a small can from the
cupboard and opened it. There was not much lard left in it.
Klein took a spoonful, put it in the pan, and melted it. He added in the
carrots and onions and stirred it for a while.
As the fragrance began to pervade, Klein poured all the mutton into the pot
and fried it with care for a while.
He should have added cooking wine in the process, or red wine at least.
However, the Moretti family did not have these luxuries and could only
drink a glass of beer a week. Klein had to make do with whatever was
available and poured in some boiled water.
After stewing for about twenty minutes, he opened the lid, put the tender
peas and cut potatoes in it, and added a cup of hot water and two spoons of
salt.
He closed the lid, lowered the fire, and exhaled satisfactorily, waiting for
his sister to reach home.
As seconds turned into minutes, the fragrance in the room intensified. There
was the allure from the meat, the rich smell of potatoes, and the refreshing
scent of onions.
The smell gradually mixed up, and Klein swallowed his saliva from time to
time, keeping track of the time with his pocket watch.
After more than forty minutes, some not-so-brisk but rhythmic footsteps
approached. A key was inserted, the handle was turned, and the door
opened.
Before Melissa came in, she whispered doubtfully, “Smells good…”
With her bag still in her hand, she stepped in and glanced over at the stove.
“You made this?” Melissa took off her veil hat and her hand paused mid-air,
looking at Klein in astonishment.
She twitched her nose and inhaled more of the fragrance. Her eyes quickly
softened, and she seemed to find some confidence.
“You made this?” she asked again.
“Are you afraid I’d waste the mutton?” Klein smiled and returned with a
question. Without waiting for an answer, he said to himself, “Don’t worry, I
specifically asked Welch to teach me how to cook this dish. You know, he
has a good cook.”
“First time?” Melissa’s eyebrows creased subconsciously, but they were
smoothed by the fragrance.
“It looks like I’m talented.” Klein laughed. “It’s almost done. Put your
books and veil hat down somewhere. Go to the bathroom and wash your
hands, and then get ready to taste it. I’m very confident about it.”
When she heard her brother’s orderly arrangements and saw his gentle and
calm smile, Melissa stood rooted at the door and failed to respond in her
daze.
“Do you prefer the mutton to be cooked longer?” Klein urged with a laugh.
“Ah, okay, okay!” Melissa jolted back to her senses. With handbag and veil
in each hand, she rushed into the room quickly.
When the lid of the saucepan was uncovered, a sudden blast of steam
appeared before Klein’s eyes. Two pieces of rye bread were already placed
to the side of the mutton and tender peas, allowing them to absorb the
fragrance and heat to become soft.
By the time Melissa had packed her items, washed her hands and face, and
returned, a plate of stewed mutton with tender peas, potatoes, carrots and
onions was already placed on the table. Two pieces of rye bread, colored by
a light dip into the gravy, were on their plates.
“Come on, try it.” Klein pointed to the wooden fork and spoon next to the
plate.
Melissa was still a little confused. She didn’t refuse; she picked up a potato
with her fork, put it into her mouth and bit it lightly.
The taste of the starchy potato and gravy fragrance flooded her mouth. Her
saliva secretion went crazy as she gobbled down the potato in a few
mouthfuls.
“Try the mutton.” Klein gestured at the plate with his chin.
He had tasted it just now and thought it was barely at a passing standard,
but it was enough for a girl who was inexperienced with what the world had
to offer. After all, she only ate meat occasionally.
Melissa’s eyes were filled with anticipation as she carefully forked some
mutton.
It was very tender and, as soon as it entered the mouth, nearly melted. The
fragrance of the meat exploded in her mouth, filling it with delicious meat
juices.
It was an unprecedented feeling and that made Melissa unable to stop
eating.
By the time she realized it, she had already eaten several pieces of the
mutton.
“I… I… Klein, this was supposed to be prepared for you…” Melissa
blushed and stammered.
“I’d nibbled some of the food just now. It’s the privilege of being a cook.”
Klein smiled and soothed her sister. He picked up his fork and spoon. At
times, he would eat a piece of meat and sometimes, he would stuff his
mouth full of peas. At other times, he would put down the utensils, break
off a piece of rye bread and dip it in gravy.
Melissa relaxed and was immersed in the delicacy again by Klein’s normal
behavior.
“It’s really delicious. It doesn’t seem like you were doing it for the first
time.” Melissa looked at the empty dish and praised him with all her heart.
Even the gravy was finished.
“It’s a long way from Welch’s chef. When I’m rich, I’ll take you and
Benson out to the restaurant and have a better meal!” Klein said. He was
beginning to look forward to it himself.
“Your interview… Burp…” Melissa did not finish her words because she
suddenly let out a sound of contentment involuntarily.
She put her hand over her mouth in a hurry and looked embarrassed.
The fault is with the stewed mutton with tender peas just now! It was just
too delicious.
Klein laughed secretly and decided not to make fun of his sister. He pointed
to the plate and said, “This is your mission.”
“All right!” Melissa stood up immediately, took the basin and rushed out
the door.
When she came back, she opened the cupboard to check the condiment box
and other items as per normal.
“Did you just use them?” Melissa was surprised, and turned to Klein,
holding the black pepper bottle and lard can.
Klein shrugged his shoulders and laughed.
“Just a little. It’s the price of a delicacy.”
Melissa’s eyes twinkled, her expression changing for a few moments,
before she finally said, “Let me cook in the future.”
“Um… You have to hurry up and prepare for the interview. You have to
think about your job.”
