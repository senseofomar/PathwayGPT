Chapter 77

: Remnant Items
“Alright,” answered Leonard with a relaxed expression when he heard
Dunn’s suggestion.
Following that, everyone walked out of the warehouse and came close to
where Monster Bieber had “self-destructed.” With him at the origin, they
began searching outwards radially.
“Captain, what are we looking for?” Klein looked at the rotting flesh and
blood that was strewn everywhere. He held back his urge to retch as he
looked at Dunn Smith beside him ponderingly.
Dunn did not look up. Instead, he used his deep gray eyes to sweep the
ground.
“Awakening ahead of time, losing control, and becoming a monster. This
means that Ray Bieber did not fully absorb the Beyonder powers provided
by the notebook. It also means that a part of his body is considered
extraordinary, making it prime material.”
“If you ever encounter something similar, make sure not to miss out on
doing a search. It might be a relatively important item.”
So that’s the case… Klein nodded slightly in enlightenment.
In the blink of an eye, he thought of another matter.
If the part where Monster Bieber had concentrated the Beyonder powers
were some indescribable part, wouldn’t that be awkward… Wouldn’t it be
extremely disgusting to concoct it into a potion…
Just as Klein’s mind wandered, Borgia with his sharp eagle-like eyes
suddenly shouted.
“Found it. Ahem.”
Dunn and company immediately turned and closed in. Driven by his
curiosity, Klein walked over to Borgia with a quickened pace.
Soon, he saw the item before Borgia. It was a grayish-white item about the
size of a fist. Its surface was filled with gullies and it looked soft but
ductile. It looked like a brain that had been extracted out of a living being.
Although Klein was unable to make out the extraordinariness of the blob of
grayish-white, he was certain that Borgia had not made a mistake since it
had remained intact despite the violent explosion it had undergone.
Dunn carefully observed it and squatted down. As he extended and bent his
right arm, he used his black-gloved left hand to carefully grab the grayish-
white item.
The moment it was touched, the blob of grayish-white immediately spread
out into an extremely sticky liquid.
At that moment, Aiur Harson took out a tin-colored square case, removed
the cigarettes from them and placed them into his pocket.
Then, he handed the square case to Dunn and smiled.
“I know, you only like pipes.”
Dunn chuckled and took the square case. Then, he “poured” the grayish-
white sticky liquid into the case for temporary storage.
After storing it away, everyone did a cursory sweep of the area.
After confirming that they had not missed out anything, they left. When
they came out, they saw the horses digging their hooves into the ground,
clearly spooked and nervous. They had nearly escaped their reins.
“I’ll drive.” Borgia covered his mouth with his hand and coughed softly.
“I know you are good at placating animals,” said Aiur with a smiling nod.
After boarding the carriage, Dunn, Lorotta, Aiur Harson, and Klein, who
continued their “arm exercises,” temporarily had nothing to say as they fell
into silence.
When the trotting of the horses sounded while the carriage wheeled off,
Dunn looked at Klein and deliberated over his words before saying, “I
know you are filled with curiosity about the Antigonus family’s notebook.
You wish to understand what happened.”
No, not at all… Klein subconsciously denied.
It was an ancient relic filled with misfortune!
Without giving him time to answer, Dunn continued and said, “However, I
have to first report this to the Holy Cathedral. Only after they determine the
confidentiality level of the notebook can we consider if this can be shown to
you.”
“No problem.” Klein gave a short and simple reply.
Dunn continued his arm exercises as he thought before saying, “I once
promised that you can be made a formal member of the Nighthawks when
we confirm that Ray Bieber is a descendant of the Antigonus family clan.
Now, not only have we determined Ray Bieber’s identity, we have even
eliminated the monster and spoiled the Secret Order’s conspiracy.
“In this entire process, your performance was outstanding. You personally
killed a member of an evil organization. Therefore, I will fulfill my promise
and immediately make an application to the Holy Cathedral. We’ll wait for
their approval.
“Right, I forgot something important. I still need to ask if you are agreeable
to it.
“Mr Klein Moretti, are you willing to formally join the Tingen Nighthawks
as one of its members? Your salary will increase severalfold, reaching six
pounds a week. Furthermore, you will get a raise every subsequent year.
“Your salary will be paid by the Church and Awwa County’s Police
Department equally. You will also gain the identity of a probationary
inspector. It will be very useful at times.
“As a support-type Beyonder, you do not always need to face enemies, but
you will have to guard Chanis Gate once a week…
“Without the squad’s permission, you are not to leave Tingen without
permission. Furthermore, you have to keep this a secret from your
family…”
…
By the time Dunn finished listing the restrictions and benefits, Klein was
already thinking deeply for more than ten seconds.
“I wish to become a formal Nighthawk.”
Only by doing so could he continue to gain more access to mystery, such as
the situation regarding the Secret Order!
After reading the gathered Roselle diaries, Klein had some changes in
thoughts about himself. “Being skilled in mysticism knowledge to seek a
way home was an immutable goal of his. Raising his strength further to
more safely make the mysterious space above the gray fog do his bidding
before using it to return home was a new addition to his goals.
Just as Emperor Roselle said, simply relying on external powers was very
dangerous!
Furthermore, after becoming a Seer and obtaining Beyonder powers, Klein
sensed that he had a better grasp of the mysterious space. For example, he
could pull another person into the Gathering.
This forced him to consider what possibly beneficial changes would happen
to the mysterious space above the gray fog when he reached Sequence 8,
Sequence 7, or an even higher Sequence.
Of course, Klein knew very well that this was built on the premise that he
completely resolved the side effects of the Seer potion. He could not rush or
be rash.
“Very well. Once the Holy Cathedral approves of it, you will become one of
us.” Dunn’s gray eyes were tinted with a hint of joy.
At that moment, Aiur Harson, who was listening in, interrupted.
“Klein, don’t mind me calling you Klein. Your performance today was
really excellent. You managed to kill a Beyonder from the Secret Order. I
even suspect that he has reached Sequence 7. How did you do it? I really
find it incredulous.”
The question has finally been raised… Having long prepared for it, Klein
acted as though he was organizing his thoughts.
He knew that it was indeed incredible and enigmatic that he had killed a
Beyonder that ran rings around Dunn, Aiur, and Lorotta. Aiur and company
were not blind or dumb, so it was a matter of time before they inquired
about the process. However, he never expected them to wait till this
moment.
That’s right. Captain and Mr. Harson were previously injured and their
situations could have worsened at any time. At that moment, any matter that
could result in conflict had to be put on hold. It was to prevent me from
acting desperately because of my exposed “secret.” Only after I expressed
my attitude and showed that I was willing to be a Nighthawk were they at
ease enough to ask… How crafty. They did not have any obvious
communication between themselves, but they had made the same tacit
decision…
Klein answered as though in thought, “It’s an extremely lucky event. The
clown in the tuxedo had made a fatal misjudgment.
“Back then, Sealed Artifact 2-049 was thrown near me as a result of the
explosion’s blast. It looked about five to six meters from me, but it was only
a crude observation. It was very easy to come to the conclusion that I was
within the Sealed Artifact’s area of influence.
“And back then, I was feeling faint because of the explosion. My actions
turned sluggish and looked as though I was being controlled.
“It was unknown when that suited clown came close to me in an invisible
state. He tried to entice me by offering to save me and the corresponding
Sequence 8, Clown, of the Seer potion. He wanted me to help him retrieve
the Antigonus family’s notebook. Right, he said that the Secret Order is in
control of the Seer potion’s corresponding Sequence pathway and that he
was once a Seer.”
…
Klein recounted the situation back then in detail. He even described the
theories he had back then, including how he believed that the suited clown
had divined that taking the notebook would be an extremely risky endeavor;
thus, he had changed his plans.
Of course, all the truths were used to conceal the lie made in the beginning
—that he had been controlled by Sealed Artifact 2-049.
“Divined that it was extremely risky to retrieve the notebook? Yes, it’s
indeed highly risky. However, the risk was actually because of you,” said
Lorotta with a chuckle as she covered her mouth. “His divination was right,
but it caused him to end up in a fatal situation. This sure is an interesting
account.”
Klein was taken aback before he nodded seriously.
“Indeed. Divination is never crystal clear. And that vagueness only means
that an interpretation can be wrong.”
Yes, I have to take note of that!
“How did you finish him off after that?” asked Dunn while he did his arm
exercises and leaned back.
Klein smiled.
“I pretended to agree to him and made him awaken me. However, he did
not dare enter the effective range of the Sealed Artifact. He stayed two to
three meters away and used a strange paper slip in an attempt to push me.
“I seized the opportunity and pulled at his paper slip, causing him to be
thrown into 2-049’s effective range. I then complemented it with repeated
shots and completed my goal. Heh, it’s quite an embarrassing matter for me.
I didn’t even have the confidence of hitting him despite being only two to
three meters away from him.”
Aiur nodded slightly.
“With his evasive abilities, a distance of two to three meters is not an
absolute guarantee. You might be able to strike him but fail to hit him in a
vital spot. That would only make things worse… Your choice back then was
impeccable. It can even be said to be outstanding. If I were in your shoes, I
might not have been able to do it better than you.”
He did not ask further. After all, the suited clown’s entry into the Sealed
Artifact 2-049’s area of influence basically sealed his fate. He became a
living target.
“The subsequent Sequence of Seer is Clown… How odd…” Dunn suddenly
said with a sigh.
