Chapter 94

: Hidden Sage
“The Fallen Creator… Fallen…” Alger ruminated over The Fool’s words
and fell deep in thought.
However, what struck Alger the most was The Fool’s relaxed, natural, and
nonchalant attitude.
He acted as if they were equal!
If he hadn’t experienced their previous ritual, Alger might have thought The
Fool was merely bluffing, and building himself up to intimidate him and
Justice. But now, he was of the opinion that even if The Fool was inferior to
the True Creator, he was at least close to that level.
It’s dangerous. It’s also an opportunity… Alger muttered softly. He then
spoke with a smile, “Mr. Fool, your description is indeed more appropriate.
According to our observations, Beyonders who believed in the True
Creator, no—the Fallen Creator, have a higher probability of losing control.
The rest of them are mostly psychopaths.”
That’s something that the Nighthawks’ intelligence mentioned as well… And
the so-called ‘psychopaths’ didn’t lose their sanity; instead, their ideologies
become twisted… Klein maintained his seated posture but didn’t continue
with the conversation.
He was still considering how to inquire about the Secret Order and Clown
potion, but he couldn’t figure out a way of asking the questions in a way
that fit with his persona.
It’s such a pity that the Gathering is still so different from an Internet forum.
Otherwise, I could create another smurf account to join the Gathering, and
that account would be in charge of asking questions that are inconvenient
for me to ask… Perhaps, one day, I’ll learn mirror-related magic and give it
a try. For example, I can make half the members here my smurf accounts…
There are twenty-two chairs here, and there are twenty-two cards in the
tarot deck. That matches up perfectly. But when I ‘created’ this divine hall, I
didn’t even name myself ‘The Fool’ or have any intention of forming a
‘Tarot Club’. Hmm, do these symbolize the twenty-two different Sequence
pathways?
I wanted a divine hall, so a divine hall appeared. If I wanted a smurf
account, would I get a smurf account…
Upon seeing The Fool remain silently engulfed in the thick gray fog,
Audrey asked both wistfully and curiously, “That sounds scary. Mr. Hanged
Man, could you share, in detail, information about each, and every
mysterious organization? And also the matters regarding each secret cult?
It’s hard for me to come into contact with them during my daily life. I can
only understand them through the both of you. I’m willing to pay for it.
May I know what you’d like in return?”
That’s a great question! Miss Justice, you’re playing the role of my smurf
account to a certain extent… This way, The Hanged Man will definitely
bring up the Secret Order… You’re the best! Klein’s mind stirred when he
heard that, but he didn’t let his emotions show through his expression or
movements.
Alger thought for a moment before saying, “I need money—a thousand
pounds. It’d be best if they weren’t bills marked by a serial number. Or
maybe gemstones that have just been unearthed. Price them according to
the Backlund Jewelry Exchange’s monthly average price.”
A thousand pounds? That’s a huge sum of money. It could be used to buy a
house in a high-class street in Tingen City! Not everyone would have that
available immediately… Captain might have an annual salary like that, I
guess? Hayley’s death compensation was only three hundred pounds…
Although Miss Justice is a noble, she obviously hasn’t inherited her family’s
wealth yet, and she’ll only be receiving some sort of annual allowance…
Hmm, it’s no wonder that The Hanged Man stated that it could be paid via
gemstones… Klein was very sensitive towards monetary figures. Luckily,
he was blanketed in thick fog.
For a single lady or madam, two thousand pounds could let her live a decent
life!
If two thousand pounds were invested, the investment could reliably
produce an annual return of about a hundred pounds.
“A thousand pounds?” Audrey said, sounding shocked. She then replied
happily, “No problem, do I send it to the previous address?”
Judging by Miss Justice’s tone, she finds it very cheap? Klein didn’t look
over.
Alger was quiet for a good twenty seconds before he said, “Yes, send it to
the Warrior & Sea Bar at Pelican Street, in the White Rose Borough of Pritz
Harbor. Tell the boss, Williams, that it’s what the ‘Captain’ wants.
“Alright.” Audrey leaned back and posed in a Spectator-like manner. “Mr.
Hanged Man, you can start now.”
Alger looked at The Fool, deliberated for a moment before saying slowly,
“Let’s start from the Moses Ascetic Order. It is the earliest hidden
organization. Of course, many think that the earliest hidden organizations
are the Church of the Evernight Goddess, the Church of Mother Earth, and
the Church of the God of Combat.
“These people must be from the Church of Lord of Storms, the Church of
Eternal Blazing Sun, or the Church of the God of Knowledge and Wisdom,”
Audrey refuted sulkily.
The Church of the Goddess is the earliest hidden organization? That was
the first time Klein had heard of such a claim.
What exactly happened in the Fourth Epoch or the Third Epoch?
Alger smiled and said, “The truth is buried in ancient history. Only one
thing is certain: no one has ever said that the Church of Lord of Storms, the
Church of Eternal Blazing Sun, or the Church of the God of Knowledge and
Wisdom were once hidden organizations.
“Alright, let’s save some time and return to main topic. The Moses Ascetic
Order was first established by a few humans that had read the Blasphemy
Slate. They believed in an non-anthropomorphic god, called ‘the Hidden
Sage’.”
“The description is that of a god, but it is more of an ideology, a natural law.
For example, all objects are numeric. The Hidden Sage is an embodiment of
Spirit Numerology. Or that knowledge is supreme, and the Hidden Sage is
knowledge itself. Hence, the original Moses Ascetic Order was a very
respectable organization, and it maintained a good relationship with the
other major churches.
“The members of the organization led ascetic lives to resist losing control
and to resolve the effects of the Remnant potion. They strictly kept their
order’s secrets, and they upheld moral and religious precepts. They believe
that humans continuously reincarnate after death…
“The Sequence 9 that they grasp is called Mystery Pryer… The word
‘Warlock’ was also spread from that organization.”
Audrey listened to The Hanged Man’s description carefully and asked
sharply, “You said that the Moses Ascetic Order used to be a respectable
organization. Are they not one anymore?”
Alger nodded his head indiscernibly.
“Yes, they have fallen into corruption and are now an evil organization.”
“Why? I find their beliefs very good and very normal,” Audrey expressed
her confusion.
That was Klein’s confusion too. The information that he could get at his
security clearance didn’t provide the reason for the Moses Ascetic Order’s
fall from grace.
Alger looked at the unfathomable Fool and tersely agreed.
“I am not sure of the real reason. It might be because it has been buried by
history. However, I have heard one terrifying explanation.
“In that story, the main reason why the Moses Ascetic Order fell into
corruption was because the god that they believed in, the Hidden Sage, had
come to life!
“He became the personification of an evil god!”
“Came to life? This… how?” Audrey found it unimaginable as she replied
with an incredulous tone.
Without realizing it, she had exited from her Spectator state.
It’s like a horror story, but the ghost is even a god… Klein’s heart stirred
with a surge of emotions as well.
“I’m sorry, no one knows the answer.” Alger had originally wanted to
casually say, “Maybe Mr. Fool would know,” but he held back the urge.
He had already teetered on the borders of danger once.
In the The Book of Storms 5:7, there was a saying that Alger remembered
clearly, which was: “Do not test God!”
Audrey calmed herself down and didn’t press for more answers. She
gestured for him to continue.
Klein maintained his seated posture and his silence, validating The Hanged
Man’s descriptions with his own understanding.
Finally, he realized that there were four points that he needed to take note
of.
First, the Demoness Sect was also known as the Demoness Family in the
Fourth Epoch. Back then, they had very few members, and their beliefs
were passed down through their bloodlines. Plus, they would kill the fathers
of their children and abandon the baby boys. Hence, all the members were
female. Of course, that was all from Alger’s description, and there was no
way to verify it at the moment.
Second, the Numinous Episcopate that believed in Death and the Rose
School of Thought that liked bloody sacrificial worship ceremonies both
originated in the Southern Continent. After the colonial era came, they
almost vanished under attacks by the seven churches. But as such, they
began spreading to the Northern Continent.
Third, the current Psychology Alchemists was similar to the earlier Moses
Ascetic Order. They believed in an non-anthropomorphic existence and
believed that the human spirit could change everything.
Fourth, the Secret Order had the lowest activity level among all the other
hidden organizations. Thus, they were the most unknown. Every time they
appeared, they seem to be after something or looking for something.
What are they after or looking for? Klein suddenly recalled the diary which
he had read earlier: The leader of the Secret Order, Zaratul, cooperated with
the Roselle. His goal was to get something left behind by the Antigonus
Family.
Their appearance that time was to look for the lost notebook, the Antigonus
family notebook… Klein narrowed his eyes slightly and felt that he had
apparently found the key reason for the Secret Order’s actions.
They are after the things that the Antigonus family left behind!
Klein suppressed his urge to tap the edge of the table as his thoughts
appeared one after another.
Oh, they were looking for remnant traces the Antigonus family left behind?
Then must I direct my focus onto these areas to obtain the Clown potion
formula from the Secret Order?
After a further exchange of information, Klein announced the end of the
Gathering.
“By your will.” Audrey and Alger stood up together.
Cutting off the connections, he saw both their figures shatter and disappear.
Klein rubbed his glabella and attempted conjuring a smurf account with his
mind.
As he thought, a figure appeared at the furthest end of the long bronze table.
That figure was wearing a black tuxedo, a silk top hat, and a dull
expression. His actions were clumsy and inarticulate. Even though he was
engulfed in gray fog, it was obvious that something was wrong with him.
That won’t do… Klein experimented a few more times before sighing and
dismissing the idea of creating a smurf account.
He attempted other things too. He continued to sit above the gray fog in the
seat of honor at the long bronze table. He considered what Audrey had said,
and he cast his gaze curiously at the illusory crimson stars.
After a moment of silence, Klein started to pray as a form of feedback
instead of establishing contact with those stars.
Amidst the tranquility and silence, he didn’t receive any feedback from the
ten plus crimson stars nearby.
In order to receive feedback, I need to pull someone above the gray fog
before I can reply? Klein nodded as he thought, feeling somewhat
disappointed.
He didn’t want to violate someone else’s will and forcefully pull them into
this mysterious space.
Hmm… Klein was just getting ready to leave, but he habitually touched a
nearby illusory crimson star.
Just then, he suddenly felt that there was a faint and insignificant prayer
deep inside the crimson star!
