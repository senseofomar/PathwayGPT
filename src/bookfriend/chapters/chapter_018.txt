Chapter 18

: Origin and Cause
Upon hearing Klein’s question, Dunn looked out of the window toward the
corridor that led to Chanis Gate. He took out his pipe, stuffed it with some
tobacco and mint leaves, and held it to his nose. He took a deep whiff as his
voice turned reflective and drifting.
“Only at home can I enjoy the beautiful flavors of tobacco mixed with mint
leaves without any worries… Klein, do you know about the creation
myth?”
“Of course, when I received primary education during Sunday school, we
learned to read using The Revelation of Evernight. Among them, the Book
of Wisdom and the Letters from the Saints mentioned the myth of creation.”
Klein attempted to recall via the memory fragments of the original Klein.
He slowed down his tempo and said, “The Creator awoke from Chaos and
shattered the darkness, creating the first ray of light. He then fused himself
completely into the universe and made up all of existence. His body became
the land and stars. One of his eyes became the sun, while the other became
the crimson moon. Some of his blood rushed into the seas and rivers,
nourishing and nurturing lives…”
Klein subconsciously paused when he said that. Partially, it was because the
relevant memories were a blur and that the creation myth was very similar
to the Chinese creation myth of Pangu.
The imaginations of people from different worlds shared something in
common on their myths and legends!
Noticing that Klein was having ‘trouble,’ Dunn smiled and added, “His
lungs turned into the elves; His heart turned into the giants; His liver turned
into the treants; His brain turned into the dragons; His kidneys turned into
the feather serpents; His hair turned into the phoenixes; His ears turned into
the demonic wolves; His mouth and teeth turned into the mutants, and His
remaining bodily fluids turned into the sea monsters, of which the essence
was Naga. His stomach, His small and large intestines, and the evil parts of
His body turned into devils, evil spirits and various kinds of unknown
maleficent existences. His spirit became the Eternal Blazing Sun, the Lord
of the Storms, and the God of Knowledge and Wisdom…”
“His wisdom gave birth to humanity. That was the first Epoch, the Chaos
Epoch.” Klein finished the last sentence for Dunn, but he found it funny and
ridiculous.
As a keyboard folklorist, it was the first time he came into contact with a
creation myth that was ‘arranged’ in such great detail. It was so detailed that
almost every prominent race corresponded to a particular body part of the
Creator.
It’s like a children’s song with children sitting in a row and eating fruit…
Furthermore, it was not only mentioned in the canon of the Evernight
Goddess. The Churches of the Lord of Storms and God of Steam and
Machinery also had similar descriptions. None of them alleviated
themselves or devalued the other gods…
This either means that the creation myth is real or hints that the few
Churches had undergone a long period of strife before compromising before
the Fifth Epoch…
With this in mind, Klein suddenly had another question. He asked with a
frown, “It feels problematic. Why are the Eternal Blazing Sun, Lord of
Storms, and God of Knowledge and Wisdom born directly from the
Creator’s spirit, while the Goddess isn’t?”
In the Revelation of Evernight’s prehistorical records, the Evernight
Goddess had only awoken at the end of the Second Epoch. Together with
the Lord of Storms, Eternal Blazing Sun, and other gods, she blessed and
help humanity survive the Cataclysm. It was also known as the Third
Epoch, the Cataclysm Epoch.
It was during that time that Mother Earth and the God of War appeared as
well. As for the God of Steam and Machinery, whose original name was the
God of Craftsmanship, He was born only in the Fourth Epoch.
In that sense, the standing among the gods seemed self-evident.
The ones who were more ancient was more orthodox. It was extremely
clear!
This also troubled the believers of the Evernight Goddess.
Dunn Smith held his pipe with another hand and instead of answering, he
returned with a question, “Repeat the Goddess’s full title.”
Klein immediately felt like he had stabbed himself with a knife. He racked
his brains and tried his best to recall.
“The Evernight Goddess is nobler than the stars and more eternal than
eternity. She is also the Lady of Crimson, the Mother of the Secrets, the
Empress of Disaster and Horror, Mistress of Calm and Silence.”
Thankfully, Klein’s mother was a devout believer of the Evernight Goddess.
When she was still alive, she would recite this every evening at dinner.
Even though the memories of the original Klein had fragmented, not all was
lost.
“What does the Lady of Crimson symbolize?” Dunn asked with a guiding
tone.
“The red moon.” The moment Klein answered, he immediately understood.
“Then which part of the Creator did the red moon come from?” asked Dunn
with a smile.
“A single eye!” Klein and Dunn smiled at each other.
This was no way less impressive than the Lord of Storms who was formed
from a third of the Creator’s spirit!
As for the Churches of Mother Earth and the God of War, they likely had
similar explanations. However, the God of Steam and Machinery had been
born too late to find a reason; thus, their church had been weak in the past
thousand plus years. It was only with the invention of the steam engine that
they seized the opportunity to truly be on par with the other gods.
Dunn stroked his pipe gently.
“Humanity was born out of the wisdom of the Creator, so we have clever
and extraordinary brains, but lack other magical powers. However, from the
creation myth, we can form a simple but clear conclusion. Everything stems
from the same origin.”
“Stems from the same origin…” Klein repeated the last few words.
“According to this conclusion, humans who are protected by the gods were
able to resist the giants, devils, and the mutants. Gradually, they figured out
means to obtain the power of the Beyonders. That is by using the
corresponding parts of the evil spirits, dragons, monsters, magical trees,
flowers, or crystals and combining them with other materials to form
potions. By consuming and absorbing the potion, one will gain different
powers. This is common knowledge among mysticism studies.”
Dunn did not elaborate in detail and only gave a brief introduction. “In this
process, our ancestors relied on painful lessons to discover that if they were
to consume high-grade or extraordinary potions, it would easily lead to
tragic consequences. There are three possible outcomes.”
“Which three?” pressed Klein curiously.
“First, mental death and the complete breakdown of a body. Every piece of
flesh would become a terrifying monster. Second, their personality will be
changed by the powers contained in the potion. They will turn cold,
sensitive, irascible, cruel, and indifferent. Third, well…” Dunn put down
his pipe and picked up a porcelain cup and took a sip. “Fermo coffee from
the Paz River Valley is bitter, but very fragrant. It leaves a splendid
aftertaste. Do you want one?”
“I prefer coffee from the Feynapotter plateau. Of course, I have only drank
it a few times at Welch’s place.” Klein politely declined. “What’s the third
outcome?”
“Mental disorder. Turning crazy on the spot, becoming more devilish than
the devil. This is what it means by losing control.” Dunn emphasized the
words ‘losing control.’
Without waiting for Klein to say a word, he put down his coffee cup and
continued, “After a long period of experimentation and exploration,
together with the birth of the Blasphemy Slate, humans have finally
perfected the potion system. We formed a tiered system that chains into
stable progression paths known as Sequences. The lower the number in a
Sequence, the higher the grade of a potion. At this point, the seven major
churches each control at least one complete Sequence. Besides, there are
also incomplete ‘paths’ that they have gathered over the past hundreds or
thousand years.”
“Blasphemy Slate?” Klein sharply noticed the term.
At the Gathering, The Hanged Man had also mentioned it!
According to The Hanged Man, the Blasphemy Slate was the most critical
factor of a potion’s system formation and completion!
That seemed to contradict what Dunn had just said.
“Those were things created by some evil gods. As for which era it appeared,
what it contains or what’s so special about it, I am unsure as well. If you
discover any clues, you have to immediately report it to me. It deserves the
highest level of response,” said Dunn vaguely. “I mentioned one of the
types of losing control. I’ll now tell you the remaining four.”
“Alright.” Klein pushed the question of the Blasphemy Slate to the back of
his mind and listened attentively.
“Although humans have clever minds, they lack extraordinary powers, it is
not absolute. There are always a few lucky ones; perhaps I should call them
the unlucky ones. They are born with relatively higher perception. Well, it
also means the ability to sense spirits. They can hear voices that others
cannot hear and see things that others cannot see. They have partial
characteristics of Beyonders.”
While Dunn spoke, he looked at the empty air around him and watched
Klein shudder in fear. “In other words, if they are half a Sequence 9
Beyonder and have fixed characteristics. Oh, Sequence 9 is the lowest grade
in the ‘chain…’ In short, they can only choose a corresponding, fixed
Sequence pathway. If they consume other potions, the effects might range
from mental disorders to a loss of control, or even worse, death.”
“Got it.” Klein nodded slowly.
“The third kind is similar to the second kind. Once you choose a Sequence
chain, you will be forced to go down that path. There will be no room for
regret. If you were to consume potions from the corresponding Sequence of
other ‘paths,’ there will be a high probability you will get mixed, unusual
and warped powers. But it is almost certain that you would be in a semi-
deranged state; sensitive and irascible, cruel and bloodthirsty, and silent and
melancholic.
“And there is only one such opportunity. After that, regardless if you
consume the potions from the original path or potions in the present
Sequence, the only result is a loss of control. The outcome could then be
mental death; alternatively, the body breaks down into monsters or even
transforms into an evil spirit.” As Dunn spoke, he lifted his coffee cup to
take a sip.
Klein, who turned alarmed and fearful after hearing this, fell silent for a few
seconds before asking, “What about the fourth kind?”
“The fourth kind, heh heh. That is the most common problem. When we
consume potions to gain powers that originally belong to extraordinary
beings, we undergo an unnatural transformation. Therefore, we would more
or less be affected by the remnant spiritual powers. While perhaps the
symptoms might not manifest and are undetectable to others, it will
definitely lurk in one’s mind. If one rushes to consume the corresponding
potion ranked higher in the Sequence before fully grasping the
extraordinary powers the potion brings and eliminating the subtle traces, the
madness will accumulate, increasing the chances of losing control…” Dunn
suddenly fell silent.
After a short pause, he said with a sigh, “As per the internal rules of us
Nighthawks, even if a teammate were to make a great contribution, they
must have consumed the last potion three years ago and be examined before
they can be promoted. Even so, there are still many who lose control every
year.”
How terrifying… Klein drew a gasp as he asked, “Then what about the final
kind?”
There was no trace of a smile despite Dunn’s curved lips.
“The fifth kind is the most common reason for a loss of control. For
Beyonders, one’s spiritual perception would be enhanced more or less. The
smaller the number in the Sequence, the more enhanced their perception.
Therefore, they would hear what others cannot hear, see what others cannot
see, and encounter things others would not encounter. They are constantly
met with mysterious enticement and illusionary bewitchment. Once they are
overstimulated or have greedy desires, they will slowly go down the path of
losing control.”
As he spoke, Dunn looked straight at Klein, his gray pupils reflecting
Klein’s figure.
His tone turned bleak as he said, “The founder of the Nighthawks,
Archbishop Chanis, once said, ‘We are guardians, but also a bunch of
miserable wretches that are constantly fighting against dangers and
madness.'”
