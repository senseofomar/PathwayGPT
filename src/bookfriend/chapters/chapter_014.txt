Chapter 14

: The Medium
A true medium… Klein repeated this description inwardly, and did not speak
again. He followed Dunn Smith down the carriage.
Welch’s place in Tingen was a detached house with a garden. The road
outside the hollowed metal gates allowed four carriages to pass through at
once. Street lamps lined the sides of the road every fifty meters. They
looked different from the ones Klein had seen in his previous life. They
were gas lamps and the height of every lamp was about that of an adult
male so that it was convenient to light the lamps.
The black metal was closely appressed to the glass, forming a checkered
pattern, casting out classical paper lantern-like ‘artworks.’ Coldness and
warmth were intertwined while darkness and light coexisted.
Walking along the pathway blanketed by rays from the sunset, Klein and
Dunn Smith entered Welch’s rented place through the ajar metal gate.
Facing the main entrance was a cemented road that led straight to a two-
floored bungalow. Two carriages could go at once.
There was a garden on the left and a lawn to the right. The pleasantly faint
fragrance from the flowers mixed with the cool scent of the fresh grass
made one feel happy and relaxed.
As soon as he stepped in, Klein shivered and peered around.
He felt that in the garden, somewhere in the lawn, on the roof, behind the
swing, somewhere in a dark corner, pairs of eyes were observing him!
There was clearly no one here; yet, Klein felt as if he was on a crowded
street.
This strange contrast—this peculiar feeling—tensed him up. A chill ran up
his spine.
“Something’s wrong!” he couldn’t help but exclaim to Dunn.
Dunn’s expression remained unchanged as he walked beside him and
replied calmly, “Just ignore them.”
Since the “Nighthawk” had said so, Klein tolerated the chilling feeling of
not being able to notice the perpetrator despite being followed, spied, and
observed. Step by step, he arrived at the main entrance of the bungalow.
If this goes on any longer, I will go crazy… As Dunn reached out his hand
to knock on the door, Klein quickly turned around. Flowers swayed in the
wind, without a person in sight.
“Come in, gentlemen.” A seemingly ethereal voice came from inside the
house.
Dunn turned the doorknob, pushed the door open and said to a woman on
the sofa, “Daly, any results?”
The chandelier in the living room was unlit. A set of two leather couches
surrounded a marble coffee table.
On the table was a lit candle, but the light emitted a cobalt blue glow. It
covered the half-enclosed living room, dining room, and kitchen in a
strange, eerie hue.
On the middle of the sofa sat a lady in a hooded black robe who wore blue
eyeshadow and blush. An exposed silver bracelet with a hanging white
crystal pendant was worn around her wrist.
At the first sight of her, Klein had an inexplicable feeling. She was dressed
just like a real medium…
Was she stereotyping herself?
Daly, the “medium” with uncanny beauty, took a quick glance at Klein with
her twinkling emerald eyes. She looked at Dunn Smith and said, “The
original spirits have all disappeared, including that of Welch’s and Naya’s.
Right now, all these little rascals know nothing at all.”
Spirits? Spirit Medium… All the invisible things that were spying on him
previously were spirits? There were so many of them? Klein removed his
hat and placed it across his chest, bowing slightly as he said, “Good
evening, Madam.”
Dunn Smith sighed. “That’s tricky…”
“Daly, this is Klein Moretti. See if you can get anything out of him.”
The medium, Daly, shifted her gaze onto Klein immediately. She pointed at
a single armchair and said, “Please, take a seat.”
“Thank you.” Klein nodded, took a few steps over, and sat down obediently.
His heart raced uncontrollably.
Whether I survive, whether I get through this successfully or have my
secrets exposed will all depend on whatever happens next!
And the thing that made him feel the most helpless was that he had nothing
to rely on. He could only place his hopes on his inherent specialness…
This feeling really sucks… Klein thought bitterly.
Next, Dunn sat on the two-seater sofa opposite of Klein. Daly took out two
thumb-sized glass bottles from her waist pouch.
Her emerald eyes smiled at Klein as she said, “I need a bit of help here.
After all, you are not an enemy, I can’t treat you harshly. That might make
you uncomfortable or put you in pain. It might even leave some serious
after-effects on you. I will give you some fragrances, making you feel
tender and smooth, which will allow you to let loose bit by bit so that you
can truly indulge in those feelings.”
That sounded wrong… Klein gaped as his eyes were filled with shock.
Seated across him, Dunn laughed and said, “Don’t be weirded out. We are
different from the fellows from the Church of the Lord of Storms. Here, the
ladies can also verbally tease men. In this regard, you should be able to
understand. Your mother was a devout believer of the Goddess. You and
your brother used to attend Sunday school at Church.”
“I understand. It’s just that I never thought that she would be such a… such
a…” Klein gestured, as he could not find the right words. He almost blurted
out the direct translation for “veteran driver 1 “.
Dunn curved the corners of his mouth up and said, “Don’t worry. Actually,
Daly seldom does this. She just wants to use these methods to calm you
down. She prefers corpses over men.”
“You make me sound perverted,” Daly interjected with a smile.
She opened one of the little bottles and dripped a few drops onto the bright
blue candle flame.
“Night vanilla, slumber flower, and chamomile, all distilled and extracted to
form this aromatic floral essence. I call it ‘Amantha;’ it means tranquility in
the Hermes language. It smells really amazing.”
As they chatted, the candle flame flickered, evaporating the floral essence
and filling the room with its aroma.
A beautifully enchanting aroma found its way into Klein’s nostrils. He no
longer felt tensed up. He was instantly calm as if he was gazing into the
darkness of the silent night.
“This bottle is called the Eye of the Spirit. Barks and leaves of drago and
poplar trees are sun-dried for seven days and decocted thrice. Then, they are
immersed in Lanti Wine. Of course, there would be several incantations
while we’re at it…” As Daly described the liquid, the amber substance
dripped onto the cobalt blue candle flame.
Upon smelling the ethereal scent of the aromatic wine, Klein noticed that
the candle flame was dancing wildly. The luster of Daly’s blue eyeshadow
and blush shone oddly, to the extent of him seeing double.
“It is a great helping hand for mediumship. It is also a floral essence that is
sufficiently enchanting… ”
As Daly explained continuously, Klein felt as if her voice was coming from
all around.
Bewildered, Klein looked around and realized that everything was swaying
and in a blur. He felt like he was shrouded by layers and layers of fog. Even
his body was swaying as it phased away before he began floating and then
losing his balance.
Colors blended like an impressionist painting—the reds were redder, the
blues were bluer, and the blacks were blacker—appearing more defined
than usual. It was dreamy and hazy. Distinct murmurs from the
surroundings came through as if hundreds and thousands of people who
could not be seen were debating.
“This feels similar to the luck enhancement ritual I did before, but without
the kind of madness that makes your head feel like exploding…” Klein
looked around and thought questioningly.
At this moment, his vision was locked onto a pair of eyes that were crystal
clear like emerald. On a blurry “sofa” sat Daly in a black robe.
Eccentrically, her gaze concentrated on the tip of Klein’s head. She smiled
and in a gentle voice, said, “Let me properly introduce myself. I am the
Spirit Medium, Daly.”
I can still… have rational thoughts… It’s like when I was at that luck
enhancement ritual and that gathering… The thought crossed Klein’s mind
as he intentionally behaved muddled and said, “Hello there…”
“The mental worlds of humans are extremely vast. Many secrets are hidden
within the mind. Look at the ocean—what we know about it is all on the
superficial level. But in reality, deep in the ocean, there is a larger unseen
portion. Other than islands, there is the entire ocean. There is the boundless
sky that symbolizes the spiritual world…
“You are the spirit of your body. Not only do you know of the islands
above, but you also know of the things hidden beneath the sea, as well as
the entire ocean…
“Anything that exists leaves some traces behind. The superficial memories
of the islands may be wiped out, but what is left under the sea and the entire
ocean will definitely have a corresponding projection left in it…”
Daly went on and on, bewitching Klein. The vague surrounding winds and
shadows took on similar forms. It as though Klein’s spirit was fully exposed
in the form of an ocean, waiting for him to search and discover.
Klein watched patiently, as he ‘churned’ the ocean occasionally. Then, in an
airy voice, he replied, “No… I can’t remember… I have forgotten…”
He expressed his agony at just the right level.
Daly tried to guide him once again, but the clear-headed Klein was
unaffected.
“Okay. We shall end here. You may leave.”
“Leave.”
“Leave…”
The airy voice lingered and Daly disappeared. The wind and shadows began
calming as the ethereal smell and subtle scent of the aromatic wine became
more distinct again.
The colors returned to their normal state and the fuzzy feeling was no
longer around. Klein’s body quivered, and he found his balance again.
He opened his eyes, which he had no memory of closing, and noticed that
the candle with the bright blue flame was still before him. Dunn Smith was
still resting comfortably on the couch. Same for Daly with the black-hooded
robe.
“Why did you use the theory that belongs to that bunch of evil madmen, the
Psychology Alchemists?” Dunn furrowed his eyebrows and stared at Daly.
As Daly put away the two little bottles, she replied calmly, “I think it’s
pretty accurate. At least, it corresponds with some of the things I’ve made
contact with before…”
Without waiting for Dunn’s reply, Daly shrugged and said, “This tricky
fellow did not leave a single trace behind.”
Upon hearing this, Klein heaved a huge sigh of relief. Pretentiously, he
asked, “Oh, it’s over? What happened? It felt like I just took a nap…”
That was a pass, right?
Thankfully, I had the ‘luck enhancement ritual’ as a rehearsal!
“Just take it as such.” Dunn interrupted him and looked at Daly. “Have you
examined Welch’s and Naya’s bodies?”
“The corpses can tell us a lot more than you can imagine. It’s such a pity
that Welch and Naya had indeed committed suicide. So, the force that drove
them to it is to be feared. Not a single trace was left behind.” Daly stood up
and pointed at the candle. “I need some rest.”
The cobalt blue glow vanished, and the house was instantly inundated with
a blurry shade of crimson.
…
“Congratulations. You can return home now. But do remember, do not
reveal this incident to your loved ones. You have to promise this.” Dunn
said as he led Klein to the door.
Surprised, Klein asked, “Is there no need to examine the curses or the trails
left behind by the evil spirits?”
“Daly didn’t mention anything about it, so there’s no need for it,” Dunn
answered simply.
Klein calmed down. As the thought of his previous worries came to mind,
he asked hurriedly, “How can I be sure that I will be free from trouble from
now on?”
“No worries.” Dunn twitched his lips and said, “Based on statistics of
similar incidents in the past, eighty percent of the survivors of the incident
do not experience any horrifying after-effects. Yeah… This is based on what
I know… roughly… more or less…”
“Then… there’s still one fifth of those poor souls…” Klein did not dare to
try his luck.
“Then you can consider joining us as a civilian staff. This way, even if there
are any precursors, we can discover it in time,” Dunn said casually as he
approached the carriage. “Or simply become a Beyonder. After all, we are
not nannies. We can’t babysit you all day long and even watch what you do
with women.”
“Can I?” Klein questioned the statement.
Of course, he did not expect much. After all, how was it even possible to be
a part of the Nighthawks so easily and obtain the power of the Beyonders?
That was the power of the Beyonders!
Dunn paused, and turned his head sideways to look at him.
“It’s not that you can’t… It depends…”
What? The transition in his words shocked Klein. Klein stared blankly
beside the carriage before answering, “Really?”
Who are you kidding? Is it so easy to become a Beyonder?
Dunn laughed lightly; his gray eyes were hidden in the shadow of the
carriage.
“You don’t believe me, huh? Actually, when you become a Nighthawk you
lose a lot. For instance, freedom.
“Even if we don’t talk about this now, there is another issue. Firstly, you are
not a member of the clergy, nor a devotee. You can’t pick whatever you
want or choose the safest approach.”
“And secondly…” Dunn held onto the handle and hopped onto the carriage
as he went on. “Among the cases that we—us, the Mandated Punisher, the
Machinery Hivemind and other Judiciaries—have to deal with annually, a
quarter of them were a result of Beyonders who lost control.”
A quarter… Beyonders who lost control… Klein was dumbfounded.
Just then, Dunn turned slightly. His gray eyes were deep. With no sign of a
smile, he continued, “And among the quarter of cases, a large number of
them are our teammates.”
